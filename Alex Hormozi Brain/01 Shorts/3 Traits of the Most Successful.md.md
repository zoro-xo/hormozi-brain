1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 the reason most people aren't
successful is they just can't control themselves like that's it it's
impulse control they did this research study that said that ultra
successful people have three common traits number one is they have a
superiority conflicts they think they're better than everybody they
think they can do bigger things second they have crippling insecurity of

be a failure and they stay focused on it because of impulse control i
guarantee you if you delayed your ass for five years and you just
provided value to people you have bigger audience than you what to do
with but guess what no one's gonna do it and that's why most people are
successful
