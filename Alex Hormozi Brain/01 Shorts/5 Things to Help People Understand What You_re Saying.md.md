1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 here's five things you can do to get
anyone to understand what you're trying to tell the first is you take
out adverbs so when people say really very extremely it actually adds
words and makes it more confusing the second thing is speaking the
passive tone a business is valued by instead of saying that you say we
value a business this way so it goes from passive to active voice the
third way is by using shorter words and shorter sentences instead of
having colons and commas just put the period there and start the next
sentence the fourth thing is using shorter and smaller words people have
to understand what you're actually saying and the last thing is you want
to use vocabulary that everyone understands so rather than saying are
multiple different sources i might say lots of stuff
