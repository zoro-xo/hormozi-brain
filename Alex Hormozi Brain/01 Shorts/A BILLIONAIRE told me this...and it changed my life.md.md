1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 understanding the difference between
superstars and stars he said something that really stuck with me how he
identified superstars he said listen we all want superstars right and we
know him when we see him but what i have noticed is that i've never not
thought someone was a superstar and then later realized they were he
said now i've had people who came in and i thought they were superstars
and then they turned out they weren't superstars but i've never had the
reverse happen where someone comes in i don't think they're a superstar
and then they become one so i took that as a key learning for myself
which is once we're bringing in high level talent we're bringing in
leaders we're bringing in drivers if we don't immediately think that
they're a superstar then it means that they're probably not a fit for
that role they're able to solve problems bring solutions to the table
and implement them without your input oftentimes what you have to end up
doing giving up the next level of control which is control around high
level decisions you have to give people the autonomy and the power
because a superstar wants that kind of power right they want that kind
of authority they want that responsibility and they want the
responsibility because they want the credit for the outcome
