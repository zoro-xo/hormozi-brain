1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 a small agency owner asked me hey man i
think i've saturated my niche i don't think i can run any more ads to
reach more people and i said okay well how many pieces of creative are
you putting out a week and he's like oh dude we've got that covered
we're putting out seven pieces a week of new ad creative he was so proud
of that and it was great because this public call and i was like do you
want to know how many pieces of ad creative just one of my companies
puts out he was like how many and i was like we're putting out 30 every
two days and he just stood there silently and so a lot of times people
see these people who are way up on the mountain and they think oh like
they're doing something fancier than me they've got this thing they're
just doing more total volume of work than you are and they've created
the system of doing more of that advanced is not doing the fancy stuff
it's doing more of the basics and doing them at scale that is what gets
you to climb the mountain that you're looking for financially it's not
doing some magic pill that's going to knock you out of the park
