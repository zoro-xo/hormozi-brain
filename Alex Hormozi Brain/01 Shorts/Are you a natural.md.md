1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 so it's my belief if you look at
belfort you look at bradley you look at grant cardone some of the big
sales trainers that are out there almost all of them invariably have the
same story which was i started selling and was the best guy on the team
by a mile and then i tried to figure out what i was doing and so i do
think that some people naturally based on their childhood their
upbringings their whatever or just have a higher proclivity for selling
it carries over into how you recruit for selling too because we've built
a lot of sales teams and i actually have a very short allowing for
people to fail at sales cycle probably much shorter than most people and
it's just because i've never had a killer sales person who didn't do
pretty well the first week and so for me we you know we turn through
this quickly but as a result of that the team is just killers and they
know that so i like this quote from from grant cardone he says you know
my sales team's a dangerous place to work
