1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 money-wise this costs me 20 000 a month
to do all right you can scale this down however you want i also don't
have a tremendous amount of time that i allocate towards it so i have to
compensate with that with money we have a twitter editor a youtube
editor a linkedin editor a podcast editor and an ign ticktock editor and
there's two of us so times two so it's actually 40 000 a month for the
both of us the amount of time that it takes me is two days per month and
four hours per week we do one day a month of recording for shorts and
then it's usually like a half day i'll do like four to eight youtube
videos that's how much that's my investment to do this
