1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 a lot of people are trying to make
content they can do the stuff they don't get the heart right they're
doing it to serve them rather than the audience they're also doing it
from a place of zero expertise so watch a video of mine and then they'll
just pair it back a diluted version of what they heard somebody could
take every word that I say and remake a clone video and the underlying
question will always be why should I listen to you unless the speaker
has a good answer it will never go viral if you want to be a business
icon you have to accomplish a pretty significant amount of business
accolades in order to really be taken seriously don't go broad you can
still be the absolute best person who talks about dog training in Austin
and if you become more successful then you can talk about dog training
in general you can expand outwards as you gain the recognition the
evidence that would support your expertise in the arena
