1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 i believe in personality tests and
here's why i've taken every one of them under the sun and what i've
commonly seen with employees and people especially people who are
starting their entrepreneurial journey is that they want to label
themselves they want to say i'm a abcd or i'm a dbca but the thing is is
what that does is it boxes you in and then it makes it very difficult
for you to change because you've labeled yourself whereas your
personality and identity need to be fluid in order to become what is
required for the roles that you have to succeed in business on your
entrepreneurial journey
