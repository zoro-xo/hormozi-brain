1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 your work works on you more than you
work on it you build your character through the work that we do we
increase our capacity to do work itself and so if you can think about
the work that you're doing is increasing that trait rather than the
output of the work then i think it will help a lot of people get through
some of the harder times it did for me do the boring work and outwork
yourself doubt the biggest deficiency that people have is their
expectations because we have these very lofty expectations everyone's
trying to become a millionaire in 90 days when if i were to get you to
sign a contract this is i promise you'll be a millionaire in five years
but you won't earn anything for five years until you become a
millionaire would you be willing to sign it most people say they would
but they don't live like they would and i promise you that if you live
like you would you'll hit it what is my skill stack and what are my
deficiencies and which of these deficiencies are keeping me from what i
want and why am i not working on them cool
