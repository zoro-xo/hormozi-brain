1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 i did a really poor job of documenting
everything up to this point and so i was really committed to like all
right for this next phase i really want to do a better job of it we're
not the elon musks and the basos i wish that those guys had documented
what they had done like how cool would it have been to see like the vlog
of amazon in 1996. how sick would that have been and like every day is
like yup almost lost the company today six months later almost lost the
company again i thought that would have been awesome
