1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 so the best mantra that i have for
learning new stuff is that you replicate before you iterate copy it
before you make it your own and the way that you make it your own is
that you copy three four five different people's stuff and then when you
combine your learnings from those five you'll have something that's
unique that's your own and if you look at the greatest artists of all
time you look at picasso look at da vinci this is how they teach artists
they duplicate what another artist was able to do their style and then
they mix it and they make it their own and that's how you learn in
business and that's how you learn in life
