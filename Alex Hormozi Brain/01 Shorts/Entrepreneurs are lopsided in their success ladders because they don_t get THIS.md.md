1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 we have natural tendencies that we're
better at than other things i've thought a lot about this there's three
pieces to it there's skills beliefs and character traits i see the
ladder of success as having three sides you have both poles and you've
got the middle handles that you need to climb up i think that a lot of
times entrepreneurs are lopsided their skills might be you know up to
the tenth story of the building their traits might be to the sixth floor
of the left pole but the handles their beliefs might be to the third and
then they're curious and why they can't get past the third pole and then
they keep growing their traits from the six to seven their skills from
the 10th to the 11th but they can't get past the third thing it's
because they don't adequately understand what their limitation is having
that level of discernment and awareness of figuring out what my true
bottleneck is because people solve problems that aren't problems their
circumstances they put all this energy and effort i need to get another
copywriting course but copywriting's not the weak link in the chain i
think that's the piece
