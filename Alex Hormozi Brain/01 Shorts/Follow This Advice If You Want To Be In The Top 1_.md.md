1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 shout out to a mentor mind to try and
figure out if what i was doing was smart because i felt like everything
that i was doing in terms of my investing in my businesses was kind of
countered everyone else and he said this thing that just pierced me to
my soul he said alex do you want to be in the one percent and i was like
yeah he was like then stop caring about the other 99 are doing because
if you want to be in the one percent it means that literally 99 of
people are gonna be not doing what you're doing and you just have to get
really comfortable with that because it only gets rarer and the divide
gets wider as you go up the mountain
