1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 if i were a struggling gym owner right
now first thing i would do is i would get a cash flow injection and so
what i would do is probably pre-sell five to ten people for a year
because then i could get probably you know five to ten thousand dollars
of cash up front with that money i would probably go straight to paid
ads but if i didn't do that i would start with organic outreach because
you can join your local groups and you can friend request those people
message them bring them to a phone call and hey you know i'm a gym owner
in xyz area right across the street from you you know do you or do you
know anyone who might be interested in you know getting in shape or
running some crazy promotions right now right so i'm not asking you i'm
asking if you know anybody so all of a sudden i'm not really spamming
you i'm just asking for help which is a little bit different that's 100
free it just takes effort from that 140 who respond we get 30 of those
people on the phone so you get you know 42 people on the phone from the
140 and of the 42 you say you close one out of three and so you close 15
people that kind of funnel would take a full month right that's a full
month of work probably about one to two hours a day of just responding
to messages and whatnot it's a four-letter word which is work a lot of
people don't want to do that
