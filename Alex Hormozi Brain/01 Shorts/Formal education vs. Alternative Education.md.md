1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 formal education at least you know in
america for me i feel like formula education failed most of us right you
know we we put a lot of money in there's some in the u.s you can't
bankrupt out of the debt like you cannot get out of the debt that you
owe for your schooling and the entire idea the original premise of
higher education was that you'd now be a more valuable member to society
to be able to be more gainfully employed and provide value right the
problem is that the promise is undelivered right and people go in and
get the same level of income after they get a degree as as what they
could get before and if you just look at the parallel track of somebody
who took the same amount of money and spent it on what i would consider
alternative education over a four year period i would say almost
invariably the person who spends an alternative education would be far
better off four years later than somebody who partied for four years of
college
