1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 when there is no required meaning and a
lot of language changes which is should must need have to all of these
things no longer exist because there is no capital meaning so i don't
should have to must need to anything a lot of the expectations that bury
ourselves into that weigh us down are just implied shoulds have to's
musts and so if all of those disappeared then in a lot of ways it's very
liberating in business it allows me to take actions even though i know
that i shouldn't or must not or other people would judge me for not
doing it the way that they thought i should do it because there are no
rules we can live our life whatever way we want to live and that's okay
