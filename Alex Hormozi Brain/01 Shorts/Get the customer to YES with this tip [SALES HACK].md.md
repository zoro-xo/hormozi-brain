1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 my goal is to give this person power
what are the things or the frameworks we think about to get to yes and
the yes that i want from somebody is not a yes i'm going to buy but yes
i'm going to decide and i think if you can delineate that for yourself
too it takes a little bit of the pressure off selling because my goal is
to give this person power and you have to understand what power is in
order to give it so the dictionary definition is the ability to
influence or direct events or people that's the dictionary definition as
i see omnipotence so god or a god figure would be as they think it
appears so the distance between thoughts and reality there is no
distance right that would be an omnipotent being if he thinks the world
exists and so as we take steps towards that is the ideal we become more
powerful and if we can do that for our prospects we can allow them to
step into the person they want to be and make a decision to own their
one way or another
