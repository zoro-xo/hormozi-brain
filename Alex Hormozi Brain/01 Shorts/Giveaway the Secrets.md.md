1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 if you're not afraid of what you're
giving away you're giving away too much you're not giving away enough
every time I've written a book I always think to myself oh God I'm
sharing everything they won't need me anymore it's the opposite though a
lot of things are the opposite way you expect do you only get trust from
others by trusting first you only get value back by giving value first
if you're afraid of giving away all the secrets that you have I promise
you if you make content that does not contain the secrets 99 of people
will just think you suck because you give nothing because you're so
afraid of giving good stuff away
