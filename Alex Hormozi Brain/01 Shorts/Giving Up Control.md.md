1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 as entrepreneurs a lot of us start
because we want freedom but then as soon as we quit our job and then
start we have absolute control and you cannot have both freedom and
control we love the control but we want the freedom i think
entrepreneurship as a journey from like a spiritual standpoint is a
consistent relinquishing of control at each level you give up the
fulfillment and then you give up the selling and then you give up the
marketing and then you give up the managing and then you give up the
leadership and then at some point you give up even doing the vision
because there's somebody else who's just as visionary or even more than
you and so at each of these things you're giving up control but what you
get back is freedom
