1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 some of you guys may remember that they
had a warning label at the end of their advertisements that said if an
election lasts longer than four hours you know must contact a medical
professional right and so the beauty is there was a genuine risk but in
making the risk they amplified the power of the product every single guy
heard that warning and was like i could have an erection for four hours
sign me up right and so it would be like the same thing as saying like
warning when you sign up and start working with gymloc you're going to
massively increase your tax burden so like we are not liable for the
amount of taxes that you're going to have to pay as a result of the
amount of money we're going to make it's the negative consequence of the
positive that amplifies the believability of the statement if we're
warning people that the extreme adverse effects of the result that we're
promising in an extreme fashion then it makes the underlying
believability of whether or not they're going to achieve it seem assumed
this is one of my favorite persuasion tactics
