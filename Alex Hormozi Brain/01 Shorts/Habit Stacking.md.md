1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 after 10 years i finally figured out
how to put sunscreen on my face every day without forgetting i looked at
all the activities that i do every day i brush my teeth i go to the
bathroom i shower it takes 75 seconds for me to put my sunscreen on my
face i was like huh is there anything else that i do that i would have
time where i can have greasy stuff on my hands and have time to like get
it off and it won't interrupt my day i drink coffee every day and so
what i did was i put my sunscreen next to where i drink coffee so that
when i have my coffee in between i can put the stuff on in so doing i
was able to pair a habit that i always do no matter what with one that i
wanted to do and it doesn't cost me more time and so if you can add the
habit without adding the time you make it convenient to do the thing and
that's why this ends up working
