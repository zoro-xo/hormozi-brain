1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 could i do to destroy my business that
if i did this it would all stop for example if i stopped creating free
content that was better than everyone else in the marketplace i would
eventually stop getting new customers if i hired a team of people that
were not good then i would lose my reputation if i select customers that
are not going to be likely to be successful then i'm not going to create
the client outcomes and my reputation will suffer as a result these
anchors will change over time but the easiest way to discover them is
not to think what should i do to be successful but how few things that
have the biggest leverage could i do to destroy my business reverse
those and you'll find your competitive advantage
