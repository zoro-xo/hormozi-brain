1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 if you start making more money a lot of
people are curious about what they should spend money on versus what
they should cut out i'm very very conservative in terms of i've always
underspent my income by a very wide margin because for me i'm very
security driven at the end of the day it has to make sense for you
because the one thing that you have to protect above all else is your
headspace the first priority things that you should be buying are your
time back somebody to get your groceries somebody to cook your food
somebody to clean somebody to drive you those are all things that you
can buy back and as long as you can make more money in that time that
you've bought back it makes complete economic sense it really depends on
protecting you as the number one
