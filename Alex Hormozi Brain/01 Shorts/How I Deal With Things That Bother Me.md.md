1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 when something bothers you pull it out
and look at and say what happened and why is this bad and what would it
look like if it were good the two tools that I use are time and volume
the volume example is thinking okay I'm in traffic if this happened
every day would I be upset if it happened every day I'd probably expect
it which means that I would not be upset about it because it's just how
things always are and so then our expectation meets reality or if you
want to make it positive you say well what if every time I got in a car
normally it would take an hour and today it took 30. I'd be pretty
excited about it and so all we did is just change the volume on the
circumstance to recalibrate the meaning that we're choosing to ascribe
to it good or bad
