1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 before the lease was supposed to get
signed partner couldn't come up with half the money to do the gym the
night before i ended up assuming the entire gym how much did that cost
so it was supposed to be both we're gonna put 25 grand in and i had 60.
it went from me having some padding to no padding so it was 50 grand i
had 60. and so i had 10 000 left which is enough for two months rent at
that gym so i started sleeping at the gym because i couldn't afford two
rents i remember selling the entire first month and making exactly 4 973
which is the exact amount of the rent and so then i just watched it go
back down to zero and i was like this sucks the next month we made 10
grand the next month made 15 then 20 and 20. it was like 5 grand a month
all the way up to like 35 000 a month i started hiring people and
bringing people in and then by month like nine it was all outsourced so
i had the like a manager and some trainers and whatnot
