1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 this is the exact moment i know and i'm
going to fire a sales person having trained now probably 20 different
sales teams i've gotten pretty good at recognizing sales talent
understanding the extent of how much training can improve someone the
window and time that i give people continues to shorten and any kind of
transactional sales that take let's say two weeks or less in order to
close a deal you should be able to tell relatively quickly in our
company if someone has a full sales cycle and hasn't closed a deal they
usually get let go and the reason for that is because the best sales
people i've ever had always close deals in that first time period which
means that this person is not going to be one of them and if i already
know that they're not going to be a star then i don't really have a
strong incentive to keep them because they're going to decrease the
average productivity of the team and so i want to always bring people
who are going to raise the bar not lower it so that's why i fire fast
