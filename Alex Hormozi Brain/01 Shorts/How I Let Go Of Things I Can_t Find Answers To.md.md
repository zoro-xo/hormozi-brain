1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 i have difficulty ascribing reason to
current behaviors because i think we just don't know why i could create
16 different stories around why i am this way and i could probably find
people who have similar character traits to me who were not only
children so was it the fact that i was an only child that made me this
way who knows i never got chocolate as a kid and that's why you
chocolate now i'm like well maybe you just like chocolate maybe has
nothing to do with the fact you didn't have this kid and so people use
circumstances to explain current reality as though it's a reason for
rather than just like accepting it for what it is which is i just am
this way
