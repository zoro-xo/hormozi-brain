1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 paid zero percent taxes on 56 of my
income last year and it's not how you expected it so rather than have
some fancy trust set up or anything like that if you own a business and
you can increase the profit of that business let's say by 20 then
there's going to be a multiple that's applied to the value of the
business if i get an increase of two million dollars in income from my
business that would actually increase my value of my business by 10
million the value of the business that was increased is tax-free what i
got taxed on is just the income that i took from the business it really
doesn't matter what tax jurisdiction you're in the richest people in the
world many of them live in the highest tax jurisdiction it's because
they know that you don't get rich off of the income but offer the growth
of the equities that always grows tax-free
