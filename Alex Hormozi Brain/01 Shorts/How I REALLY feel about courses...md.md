1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 the reason the course that you bought
didn't make you money is oftentimes because the thing that the course
taught is not the only thing that is required to make money i bought a
course on copywriting or i bought a course on facebook ads and i didn't
make money it's not because the course was bad maybe it was it's
probably because you're missing another piece of the puzzle and that's
why it takes so long for so many people when they get into the game and
they get so frustrated at the beginning because everybody tells the
story i bought all these courses didn't work for me and then i finally
got this thing and then it all took off but many times that last course
was just the last piece of a bridge that other people helped you build
it's much more important to see it as a bridge from where you are and
where you're trying to go and each one of the bricks represents the
skill that you'll need if you do not have one of the bricks you will not
be able to continue to pass the difficulty in what most people have is
that they continue to reinforce one brick and they still have a gap spot
the gap in your learning and then attack it ruthlessly
