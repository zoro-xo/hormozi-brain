1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 unfortunately the academic system that
exists sucks most people that you see have not done the thing that they
are teaching what they do they are spouting things that they have heard
and just regurgitating them and so they do not understand why it is that
way they are saying it is that way but they lack the details they lack
the nuance of having done it and being able to troubleshoot it because
they didn't actually build the thing they observed it being built and
then relayed it to their audience and most people haven't done it you
have to do the thing well like training your back well do the sales well
in order for your skill to improve and the way to do that is a lot of
times by having somebody who is much better than you teach you how to do
it and so we have to pay or learn in other ways and i think you can
either go to a company and learn those skills specific knowledge from
doing it or you can do it yourself right like i like the idea of getting
earning while you learn right go to a company get paid to learn right i
think it's like one of the best things in the entire world
