1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 i have to make this one statement that
the person must really want the goal and believe one the product will
get you the goal the way they want to get there and i learned that
second half the hard way because we found out in gym launch that people
would say no sometimes to buying memberships but when we offered them
the ability to come back the next day help them for free we'd sell them
400 of supplements and they just said no to 100 down service thing i'm
like what the \[ \_\_ \] it's because they want to lose weight but they
want to lose weight their way and so that's when i started learning like
oh not only do we have to make sure that they want the goal and they
believe that the product's going to get them there it has to get them
there the way they want to get there the second thing is that you and
others will support them like are you telling me the truth is this
really what's going to happen will other people around me support this
decision and the third is that it will work for them and not just
everyone else sure i've seen the people who step on the stage but
they're different than me
