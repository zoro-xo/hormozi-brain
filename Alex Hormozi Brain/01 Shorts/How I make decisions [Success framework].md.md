1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 so laila and i were working out at a on
a vacation and she brought her trx thing it was a hotel gym and so they
actually had a trx hook so i hooked it there it was kind of pain in the
ass i'd like get on and like put stools together it was all the way up
and i hooked it and right as we were leaving you know after working out
i was like uh do i want to take this with me or not like because like no
one was at the gym like it was totally one of those like no one's ever
gonna see it yeah and so i'm looking at this thing like it's gonna be
painting that's to get that back up get that down and then do it again
tomorrow and the next day the next day and so i was like well what's the
upside the upside is that i save time and effort from doing that my
downside is someone steals it and i can't use it for the rest of the
workout and someone stole it can i live with the downside no okay then i
have to go get it it's just like but like that was like literally
applying yeah and i don't know if i necessarily if i didn't have that
but sometimes applying this i was like i can't live with the downside
i'll be really annoyed with that and the downside is not worth it and so
it wasn't worth the upside and so it's just applying that framework for
a lot of decisions
