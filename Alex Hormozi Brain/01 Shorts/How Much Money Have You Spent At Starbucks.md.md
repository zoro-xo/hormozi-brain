1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 a million dollars a year breaks down to
83k per month 21k per week seven days would be about 3k plus per day 21k
per week we just have to know what the lifetime value of our customer is
so let's say you're selling a single product that has no upsell let's
say your ltv is a thousand dollars just means that your total lifetime
value of a customer is a thousand dollars like starbucks i think they're
ltv's like eight thousand dollars and you're like holy cow well think
about how many times you purchased a starbucks over the last ten years
if i sold a course for a thousand dollars and i sold nothing else that
would be a thousand ltv if i sold a hundred dollar a month gym
membership and the person on average stays 10 months that would be a
thousand dollar ltv skincare products average order value was 250 and
the average amount of time that someone stayed on my cream products was
four months one thousand dollars is my ltv if i have to get to a million
dollars then i need to sell 21 units per week and then there you go you
get your 10 million
