1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 really the difference between rich
people and poor people poor people play the lottery they're trying to
only focus on the upside and they're almost happy to give away a
guaranteed downside meaning they're willing to pay money that they know
they're going to lose to potentially make more rich people never lose
money and would take a very small upside knowing that they're guaranteed
to not lose the money to put in which is why rich people are putting a
hundred percent of their net worth in crypto because all of that is
upside but there's still a potential for downside so they'll put a small
percentage into that versus all the poorest people i know have 100 of
the net worth in crypto and it could vanish tomorrow and that's the
difference between buying lottery tickets and investing
