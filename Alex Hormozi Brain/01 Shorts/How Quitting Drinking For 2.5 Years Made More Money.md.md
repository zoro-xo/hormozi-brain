1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 quitting drinking for two and a half
years made me more money i stopped being hungover i stopped spending
money on all the things that i would go out and do i stopped making the
mistakes like getting a dui and saying that i shouldn't have been saying
when i was drunk and all of those downside risks got mitigated and so
what ended up happening is i just had a smooth growth curve which
normally before that point i would grow and then crash and grow and then
crash and that solved the problem for me for good
