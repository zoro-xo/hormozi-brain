1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 people avoid taxes because they don't
make the vast majority of their wealth on their income they make it from
increases in their equities or things that they own it's the assets they
continue to appreciate and so the way that they spend the equities is
they take loans against them which loans are tax-free so if i own
something that's worth a million dollars i can take a loan against that
let's say for a hundred thousand dollars i can take the hundred thousand
dollars buy myself a watch or a lamborghini or whatever the hell and
never have to pay taxes on that because it's a loan that gets you paid
over time
