1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 cool thing about how the u.s tax code
works is that loans are never treated as income but they are spendable
money that you can consume and use for example if i continue to plow all
of my money into assets that earn while i sleep if they continue to grow
and they are growing tax free then the growth that is tax-free i can
realize by taking loans against those things and i can use those loans
to live my life and as long as the loans that i'm taking are less than
the growth of my assets then i can use all of that growth continue to
let it compound tax free for the rest of my life and live off the loans
and when i die they can they can rectify my account these are the
strategies of the people who are ultra wealthy
