1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 to actually create a profitable course
what i would consider a bad way or a hard way would be selling something
like drop shipping for amazon that's in there done that people have been
doing it forever and so trying to sell a course on that now it's a very
very polluted space as lots of competition the water is bloody on the
flip side you could still sell a course but you could do it on how to
become a blockchain developer that's going to be still the same vehicle
of business but the opportunity that we're pursuing is growing it has
people who have money who want to pay for it there's a pain and a clear
need and the best part is people are easy to target and so that's why i
would pick a second one rather than the first
