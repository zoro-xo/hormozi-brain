1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 heard someone say you need to provide
more value but what does that actually mean so there's four components
to creating value the first is you have to figure out the dream outcome
that somebody wants to achieve component number two is that your
prospects and the people you're trying to sell to they have to believe
that you're actually going to give them that outcome the third part is
how long is it gonna take me to get that outcome the shorter you can
make the time between when they buy and when they get the more valuable
it will become and then the fourth piece is the effort and sacrifice
that someone has to go through in order to achieve it the goal is to
shrink that to as much as possible so in a perfect world we'd make an
amazing promise that they believe that they can achieve immediately with
almost no effort and when we're thinking about value those are the four
things that go into it
