1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 how i choose a profitable niche so on
one hand you might hear somebody say hey i have a facebook ads agency
and i would hate to enter that business because facebook's an aging
platform the cost per impression is going through the roof it's more
competitive than ever in terms of the actual ad space and also the
amount of people that you're competing against already established and
have already built out infrastructure to outcompete you on the flip side
one degree separate would be having a digital agency that does tick-tock
or does content for youtube shorts or something those would be things
that are growing marketplaces that have lots of space that are low-cost
cpms that you can get into early on and even though the actual business
of these two things are the same the opportunity is vastly different
which is why i would go after this one rather than the facebook agency
