1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 it looks like to get in the top one
percent in order for you to get to above five million dollars so not
even top one percent top point three percent you gotta save like 15
grand a year for 30 years that's it and that's assuming just nine
percent returns which is just the stock market alex how do i save twelve
hundred dollars a month most times you're gonna wanna have to sell
something either you're selling someone else's product or you're selling
your own product my say product i mean product service whatever either
one of those categories and if you make a hundred thousand dollars a
year and you live on thirty you can do this i really believe anyone can
do it you should have to live on a lot less than you make now if part of
you is like well then what's what's the point of living it really
depends on on what you value you can either have your ego and how you
look to everyone or you can have your ego based on the freedom that you
feel so the moral of this story is getting into the top one percent is
literally a matter of saving 1500 bucks a month and putting in the s p
500 that's it and the thing is is it's so simple no one will do it
that's okay but you're a smart cookie and you're going to do it because
you think that simple things are usually the keys to the universe which
i agree with you
