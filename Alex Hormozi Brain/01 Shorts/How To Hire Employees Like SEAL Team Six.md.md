1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 i'll tell you what i learned from how
seal team six hicks from the navy seals to make seal team six and how i
used that same structure to pick who i wanted to work in my company so
in seal team six they said it's baseline it's ticket of entry that you'd
give your life for another guy in the team but to get to seal team six
you have to have even stronger and deeper character and what they look
at is would i be able to trust my wife with this person if i left for
months at a time they would be absolute men of honor to the same degree
could i trust this person with a big pile of money far more than they
had i could give it to them and i could say hey i'll be back sometime
come back one month one year 10 years later and it would still be there
as we're looking at new candidates we're asking not only do i think this
person is good character but we test that character under different
situations to see what's inside if it would come out and that's how we
see this is the type person that i want to work at my company and
represent me
