1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 you're ever announcing something and
you need everyone in your company to like do something that no one else
wants to do one of the biggest mistakes you can make is get on a zoom
call and say guys shame on you you haven't filled it out let's do better
the real way to do it sake you guys are so amazing like 90 of you guys
already filled it out if you haven't done it please go ahead and get it
done by the end of the day because you're the stragglers and you know
who you are so go get that done the difference is people want to be a
part of the majority and when you say no one else has done it then
identify like okay i'm safe i'm part of the majority and i'm doing the
right thing what you want to do is make them feel like the minority and
you make the minority what you don't want them to do and by aligning
themselves that way you can get more people to do what you want them to
do
