1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 here's how to raise your prices without
pissing anyone off the way to make any change whether it's price or
programmatic is actually to appeal to a higher ideal you will always
have The High Ground in any discussion if you go off morality and so
what that means is if I say hey I made you this promise that I wanted to
fulfill I want to help you achieve this thing I have the moral duty to
help you do that I no longer feel like the services that we have can
help it now that I know what I know now because I am a growing
entrepreneur and I've learned more things these are the things that I
have to do in order to fill my original promise and part of that means
it's going to cost more and that's okay because for me my Integrity is
number one and that is what I'm going to maintain so as a result of this
change in price these are all the additional things you're going to get
it's going to happen faster it's going to happen easier for you and all
of these because I have to stay true to my promise and that's what I'm
going to do and so when you make it that way no one can question you
because they're like why don't you raise your price you're asking me to
question my Integrity you have The High Ground no one can counter you
there and that's how you make those kind of big problematic changes that
you're afraid of making
