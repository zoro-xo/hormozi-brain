1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 this is what i say when a prospect says
they don't have enough time or they don't have enough energy to do
whatever program or services that we're trying to sell i say listen it's
not about you having the time or the energy i think we're thinking about
this the wrong way instead we need to be thinking about how to increase
your capacity to do work and so as long as you basically reframe the
problem as a capacity issue rather than a wait until this gets solved
you'll be able to overcome it and close the deal
