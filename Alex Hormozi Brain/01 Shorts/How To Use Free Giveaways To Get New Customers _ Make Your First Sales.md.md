1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 how to use free giveaways to get more
products and get your first sales going so if you're starting a business
right now the easiest thing to do is give the services away that you
have for free and you'll be like i'm undervaluing myself horseshit what
you're gaining is experience because if you have no customers you're
probably not that good at what you do and so what you should do is learn
for free because people are going to be spending cost to work with you
they're spending time they're spending effort they're deploying
resources to do the thing for whatever services you're providing so you
might as well understand that the value you're providing is probably low
in the beginning and so you go you learn you help them you get
testimonials you get referrals from those people and then you can start
charging money because at that point you'll actually be good and you'll
merit the money that you want to charge
