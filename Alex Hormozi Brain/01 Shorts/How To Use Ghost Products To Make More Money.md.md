1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 have you heard of a ghost product well
here's what it is and how it can make you more money when i had a brick
and mortar chain i actually had a series of retail products that i
actually didn't carry that existed on my purchasing menu and so rather
than saying hey go you know pick from this menu instead i said hey you
don't need this one you can probably find a cheaper version of it you
don't need this you can probably find a cheaper version here don't worry
about it but what you really need is this and this what happens is
people will trust you more if you try and save the money up front in
another way because that way what you do is you show your intention of
trying to help the prospect so what i did was i took that and went
extreme with it and just didn't even carry the products so that i could
then gain the trust to make the sale to help buy the products that they
really needed if you liked that video like follow and comment i'll see
in the next
