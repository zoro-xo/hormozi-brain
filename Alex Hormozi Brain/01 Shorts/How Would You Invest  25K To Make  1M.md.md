1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 sales guys come up to me and they're
like dude i got 25 grand you know i'm feeling pretty good so i'm just
like curious what kind of investments should i be getting into crypto's
looking pretty good right now and it drives me nuts because i'm pretty
sure i didn't have any money in my bank account at any time until i had
a million dollars in my bank account within a couple months the reason
for that was because my belief is that you should spend all of the money
that you have to acquire skills until you can't spend money on acquiring
skills anymore and you can pretty much always spend money to acquire
skills it's users do it differently and so like the higher up you go now
i have to make donations to charities in hundreds and millions of
dollars in order to get access to the boards of these charities who are
other dudes who can donate hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars
to this charity so that i can then see what they know so that i can
learn faster
