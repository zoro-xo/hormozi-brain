1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 let's say that you travel six times a
year so every two months average travel at least in the us is gonna be
two hours so if you two hour flight six times a year it's there and back
which is four hours just 24 hours the reason i'm defining this by hours
is because private jets get price per hour and if you're curious how
much it costs if you go through a service you can usually get it for
about four thousand dollars an hour so that's about a hundred thousand
dollars a year wait flying private 100 000 a year i thought it was you
had to be a super duper millionaire no not really it's 100 a year now do
i think that's really expensive for flights when the alternative to that
is first six flights could be maybe you know if you did first class
you'd be maybe spending six grand at worst if you did the last minute
you'd spend like 10 grand so 10 times the price that's the alternative
price flying private is actually really nice but it's wildly expensive
and i still feel guilty for it
