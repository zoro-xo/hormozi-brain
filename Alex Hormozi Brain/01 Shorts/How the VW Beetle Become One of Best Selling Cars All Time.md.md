1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 here's how the vw beetle became one of
the best selling cars of all time instead of saying hey we're fuel
efficient and we're sturdy and the same things that everyone else said
they just said it'll stay ugly longer and the reason that that worked so
well it was something called a damaging admission they actually set a
negative first people who speak about their own negatives as more
trustworthy if you actually want to use this in your own business you
can just say something negative before you say something positive you'll
be more persuasive but if you say something negative that relates and
could be flipped as a positive thing it actually makes it even more
persuasive for example if i had a very small facility where i did my
business i might say hey it's really small on here you're definitely not
gonna be able to fit a lot of stuff i was like we're nice and cozy if i
can flip the positive is negative which most negatives do have positive
elements you make it more persuasive and more likeable and more
trustworthy all by taking the things that you used to be afraid of and
putting them out there
