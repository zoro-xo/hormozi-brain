1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 easiest way to ask a closed question in
a sale which is where everyone always chokes is simply asking would it
be totally crazy for us to move forward today would you be totally
opposed to us moving forward today or would you be totally opposed to us
moving forward at the end of this call should be totally opposed moving
forward period when you ask it like that it's not saying hey do you want
to sign up or hey do you want to pay or hey do you want to buy right now
we're saying would you be opposed to moving forward and then the person
can feel safe and say well i'm not opposed to moving forward and you're
like awesome boom you get it and you can move forward with the paperwork
and that's one of the easiest ways to ask for a sale that's low pressure
