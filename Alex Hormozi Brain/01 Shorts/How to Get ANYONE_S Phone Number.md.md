1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 easiest way to ask for someone's number
who you're networking with or a girl that you're trying to ask out at a
bar is to ask this question after a quick exchange to say hey would it
be totally overstepping for me to ask you for your number so we can
exchange info and the thing is is when you ask someone if you're totally
overstepping we're trying to get them to say is no and people feel much
safer saying no and so you're asking hey would you totally overstepping
exchange numbers should be like no and all of a sudden you get the
number it's much easier to say that then hey can you give me your number
all of a sudden it sounds way more ascii and way more weird whereas hey
would be totally over something for us to exchange digits all of a
sudden it sounds way easier and way more laid back and that's how i've
done it for years
