1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 it looks like to get in the top one
percent in order for you to get to above five million dollars so not
even top one percent top point three percent you gotta save like 15
grand a year for 30 years that's it and that's assuming just nine
percent returns which is just the stock market alex how do i save twelve
hundred dollars a month most times you're gonna wanna have to sell
something either you're selling someone else's product or you're selling
your own product might say product i mean product service whatever
either one of those categories and if you make a hundred thousand
dollars a year and you live on thirty you can do this i really believe
anyone can do it you should have to live on a lot less than you make now
if part of you is like well then what's what's the point of living it
really depends on on what you value you can either have your ego and how
you look to everyone or you can have your ego based on the freedom that
you feel so the moral of this story is getting into the top one percent
is literally a matter of saving 1500 bucks a month and putting in the s
p 500 that's it
