1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 how to raise your price without pissing
anyone off the way to make any change whether it's price or programmatic
is actually to appeal to a higher ideal you will always have the high
ground in any discussion if you go off morality and so what that means
is if i say hey i made you this promise that i wanted to fulfill i want
to help you achieve this thing i have the moral duty to help you do that
i no longer feel like the services that we have can help it now that i
know what i know now because i am a growing entrepreneur and i've
learned more things these are the things that i have to do in order to
fill my original promise and part of that means it's going to cost more
and that's okay because for me my integrity is number one and that is
what i'm going to maintain so as a result of this change in price these
are all the additional things you're going to get it's going to happen
faster it's going to happen easier for you and all of these because i
have to stay true to my promise and that's what i'm going to do and so
when you make it that way no one can question you because they're like
why don't you raise your pressure you're asking me to question my
integrity you have the high ground no one can counter you there and
that's how you make those kind of big problematic changes that you're
afraid of making
