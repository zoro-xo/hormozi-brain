1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 people are afraid of confrontation
right that's what they're afraid of and so i believe that you can sell
without ever having confrontation and you can do that with what i like
to call childlike curiosity and so if someone says well my husband's not
going to approve that i'm like why wouldn't he like huh that's so
interesting tell me more about that rather than like all right let's
like your husband's an like that's not gonna work because in arguments
no one wins right and so you're like why would he think that because
because i would think that he wants what's best for you right yeah he
wants what's best does he know you're struggling with this right now
well i mean yeah he knows i'm struggling with it okay so he wants us
because he knows you're struggling with it so why do you think he would
be opposed to solving something that that you're currently struggling
with would he be happier if you continue to struggle well no it's like
well great you make a joke and the light is scenario then you close it
right and so i think childlike curiosity is the immediate that you have
to train because people get defensive
