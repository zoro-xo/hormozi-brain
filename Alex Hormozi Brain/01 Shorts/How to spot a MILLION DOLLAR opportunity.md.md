1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 what is opportunity how do you have a
good opportunity versus bad opportunity i see it as three variables so
you have the total number of potential units to sell how many units of
this widget could i potentially sell number one number two is what is
the value to cost discrepancy so how much profit can i potentially make
solving this particular problem and then number three is what are the
competitive dynamics within that marketplace so uh an example that has
two of the three would be like what if i wanted to sell cell phone
service lots of people need it the how much it cost me to add an
additional customer is very very low so very high gross margins but what
are the competitive dynamics well there's a lot of really entrenched
players it's very hard to get into that right and so when i'm looking at
an opportunity i want to see all three the difficulty with using those
three is that that equation can evolve over time and so if you're
starting a business right now you might not have you know sell something
that everyone in the world can buy but as you get into business you
learn more and then you realize that you can expand your market in one
way or another
