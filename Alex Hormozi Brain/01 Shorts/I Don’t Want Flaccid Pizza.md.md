1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 yeah pizza you don't want to get
delivered because it gets steamed in the box and it's all like floppy
and stuff at one time and he was like we have to throw it away yeah it
has to be crispy like i have to be able to pull a piece of pizza up if i
can crunch it sideways and and the tip always stays like that's pizza i
want to eat if it just like flops down like a flaccid you know that's
not the type of pizza i don't want flaccid pizza since i've been married
we've ordered pizza one time to the house and then he was like we must
throw this away and then we literally put in a digiorno because he was
like i can't eat this pizza let's just do the dijon
