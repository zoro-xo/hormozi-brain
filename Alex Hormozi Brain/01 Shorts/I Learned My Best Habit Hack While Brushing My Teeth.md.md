1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 I wanted to brush my teeth the same
time every day which I'd never been able to do I usually was like oh my
breath smells bad I should go brush my teeth coincided with the fact
that this comedian Jim there's Jeff gaffris I think Jeff something he
was telling this joke about his kid and that he brushes his teeth while
he pees yeah I'd like to save some time and I thought about that and I
was like maybe I'll give it a shot and so what I did was I grabbed my
toothbrush I put the toothpaste on it before I went to go pee the next
night I did the same thing and the next night I did the same thing and
then two weeks in I was like finally did this I've made a habit of this
rather than like half hourly brushing throughout the day and like
forgetting and remember it you know what I mean like I was able to do it
at the same time every day and I did it while I was big and that gave me
how I've been able to hack getting habits in
