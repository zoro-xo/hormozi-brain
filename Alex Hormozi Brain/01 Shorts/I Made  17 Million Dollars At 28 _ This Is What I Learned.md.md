1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 i was 28 years old i took him 17
million dollars in profit and here's two things that i learned about
money that no one will ever teach you number one is that money only
solves money problems once you have it you're only left the problems
that money can't solve if you have a troubled relationship with your
father money's not gonna solve that if you're insecure money's not gonna
solve that if you can't hold a relationship to save your life money's
not gonna solve that number two is that anyone who says that money can't
buy happiness is wrong because they haven't given enough away because i
look back on my life and when i die i'm probably not gonna care about
the nice condos and the cars and the jets and all that stuff but i'll
just know that two million dollars went to help thousands of kids so
they could eat and go to school
