1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 you probably get ideas you're in a
conversation i should make a piece of content on that right and then you
email it yourself that's how i did it for a long time and the new way i
post all of those ideas as tweets on twitter rather than just sending
them to myself i tweet about five times a day ish the nice thing is that
twitter is a very forgiving platform i like it because it's just
thoughts like that's i love twitter so much for that reason i'll post
this stuff and i'll be like okay those are the ones that people thought
were interesting the threads become long format or the tweets become
short format
