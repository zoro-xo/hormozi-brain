1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 with the Alex now higher 20 something
Alex I probably just asked me a lot of questions I would have noticed
that he probably saw me as a father figure and was like this is probably
not healthy for this kid at this point and given the level of ambition
that I think he has I think he will outgrow the role in a very short
period of time I would have to figure something out or I would say
listen man I think like why don't we do it one to your internship or
something like that and it would just really depend on what Alex wanted
I mean it sounds like you're saying no that you wouldn't hire him it's
because I know him
