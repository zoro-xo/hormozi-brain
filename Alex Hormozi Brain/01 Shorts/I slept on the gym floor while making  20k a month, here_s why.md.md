1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 i was taking home about twenty thousand
dollars a month for my gym and i was still sleeping on the floor and
here's why i actually very security driven i wanted to make sure that i
had a nest egg which i had pretty much blown in order to start this
business and so every month all i wanted to do was make sure that i
covered the rent of the business and then i had no employees at the time
for the first few months and so i did everything in the business so
everything above the rent was mine to keep and so every month as it went
up my profit went up but i just allowed that all into savings because i
was so worried about something potentially happening and ultimately i
think it was the right call because i was able to make bigger decisions
later because of the savings i was able to have by not getting a place
and spending stuff on furnishing and all that kind of jazz
