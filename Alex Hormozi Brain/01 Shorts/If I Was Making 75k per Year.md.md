1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 if i was making 75 000 a year and i was
deciding how much i should allocate towards my education it would be a
hundred percent of everything beyond my living expenses it depends on my
ages if i was married if i had kids etc but i would be living on ramen
because i would want as much of that money to get me out of making five
thousand dollars a year into making two hundred thousand dollars or a
million dollars a year here's what's crazy is you can buy the skills
that make you a million dollars a year for like 50 grand and people just
don't know it you will pay for the information to make a million dollars
no matter what the question is whether you want to pay with time or you
want to pay with money
