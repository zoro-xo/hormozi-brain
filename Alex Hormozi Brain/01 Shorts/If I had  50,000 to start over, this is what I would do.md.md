1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 how much money do i have let's say you
got 50 grand what's your thoughts if you were coming into this again
post covey what would you do tomorrow it depends on who i am and what my
skill set is be really difficult to open a facility and market it with
that kind of money so i probably would try and learn online if that's
all i had starting online is probably the only place that would make
sense because there's lower barrier to entry that being said there's
more competition so you have to be willing to either have a superior
skill set which would be understanding the marketing side of paid
acquisition which takes time and money to understand or having the work
ethic to do outbound for you know two to four hours a day every day to
build up my business if you have the skill set being online in general
will make you more money the big if is if you have the skill set
