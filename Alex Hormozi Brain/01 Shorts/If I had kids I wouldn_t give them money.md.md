1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 we're not big believers in legacy i
don't think that inherited wealth does anyone any good i think it ruins
people money is a tool and my favorite magic card which there's a game
called matching the gathering i played was a kid but it was um she
wished for a weapon but not the skill to wield it and so i think that
people get this very powerful tool and they don't have the skill to
wield it i think the only way to not have money own you is to know how
to generate it and then you can respect it for what it is know what its
limitations are and know what you can use it for but if i did have kids
i still wouldn't give them the money because they have to they have to
do it on their own i think it'll ruin them
