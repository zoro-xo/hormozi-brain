1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 18 year old i talk to is trying to be a
millionaire in 90 days when if i could guarantee that they'd be a
millionaire in 10 years but not have any money for the first five they
probably wouldn't do it the reality is this is how life really works
unlike video games where everything is compressed right you work out for
two minutes in a video game and you have a jacked avatar the real world
all you have to do is expand the time horizon and play it just like a
video game and you'll win every time
