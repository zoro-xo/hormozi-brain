1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 you're doing stuff and it's not working
this might be why i was starting my first gym and someone told me that i
should put flyers out and so i did put flyers out lo and behold no one
called me except for one guy who said that i'd ding this car i met with
the guy who told me to do the flyer so i was like hey man i did the
flyers they didn't work and he's like well what was your test size and i
was like well what do you mean he was like well how many did you put out
the test i was like well i put 300 out he said dude i don't even test
under 5000. whoa and that was when my entire paradigm shifted around the
amount of effort that was required to be successful i was doing the
right thing but i was doing way way way too little i see that pattern in
myself and so many other entrepreneurs who are starting out they're
trying to figure out how to post content how to run ads how to do sales
calls and they do two or five or they do it for a week and they're like
oh it's not working when the people who've been doing this game for a
long time are talking in decades not days
