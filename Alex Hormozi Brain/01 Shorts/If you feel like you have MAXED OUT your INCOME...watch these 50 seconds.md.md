1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 how do you increase your total
adjustable market like there's four ways to increase it there's five
ways to adjust it so you can go up market which means you're selling to
bigger versions of the same thing so let's say i was helping hair salon
owners i could help people who have chains of hair salons or i could
help franchisors or license orders of hair salons it'd be much a much
smaller demo but they'd be much bigger clients it'd be enterprise right
i could go down market which would be selling smaller versions which
would be like i could sell hairstylists right if i want to go down
market from there people who aspire to be hair stylists right so it's
like a pyramid you can go adjacent market which is what's similar to
hairstylist that probably has similar wants and needs so probably like
lash salon that would be an adjacent market or i could go broader so
broader is where you take all adjacent markets under one umbrella which
would be beauty right so be like i help all beauty tie brick and mortar
businesses right that would be going broader and so those are the four
ways you can increase the total addressable market of whatever thing
that you're serving
