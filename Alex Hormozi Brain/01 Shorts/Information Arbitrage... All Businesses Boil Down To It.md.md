1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 businesses boil down to information
arbitrage every single business that you ever have seen that exists
simply exists because the one person who's doing the thing understands
more about the thing than the person they're selling it to so whether
you're raising cattle it means that you know how to go and farm cattle
you know how to raise them you know how to breed them you know how to
grow them you know how to manage that versus somebody who's buying the
piece of meat every single type of business whether it's e-commerce
whether it's service whether it's software someone knows something that
someone else doesn't who's buying it and so the key to being successful
in the business that you have is to always maintain that information
advantage so that you can maximize the leverage that you have over the
opportunity that you're pursuing
