1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 i think originally the drive was from
just crippling insecurity and needing approval got immediate feedback
that was positive and then i was conditioned to continue those actions i
continued to do them without the original catalyst that got them going
to begin with i don't think i suffer you know from insecurities as much
as i used to and it might just be because i have this massive big pile
of money that i can use as an emotional crutch to why i'm not abusive i
have come to accept that i love working and i don't need to judge myself
for that or take in other people's judgment on how much i should quote
do like this is my life and this is what i like doing and their ideals
that they've arbitrarily made up as what they define as balance are
irrelevant to me
