socially acceptable shield for you not being successful in
entrepreneurship do you think do you think that that might be a reason
because if you're in college then you you're not seen as a failure if
you're not winning at the thing that you're doing right it's your side

off you know kudos to him for being able to realize and admit that but i
think that that was is such a core issue for many of us is that we
present these socially acceptable solutions to ourselves when deep down
the reason that we're doing them is not for the right reason and so in
this instance he's using it as a foil to protect himself against having
to confront the realities of life of business of the marketplace of not
being good enough right yet
