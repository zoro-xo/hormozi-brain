1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 so I get asked all the time hey do I
need to like grow my social media if I'm selling social media services
do I need to be super jacked if I'm selling weight loss or Fitness in
terms of like do I need to have walk the walk Etc the answer is you
should know how to get there I ended up selling my gyms before I ended
up helping a lot of gym owners grow their businesses the fact that I
didn't have the gyms at the time in no way questioned my authority and
my ability to help them do it because what you need to articulate is not
have I done it but have I taken people just like you where you want to
go and how many times have I done that and if you can articulate that
the prospect then it doesn't matter whether you have a six-pack or
you're just in medium shapes at the end of the day if you've taken 100
people who look just like them to where they want to go you're credit
worthy and more credit worthy than just some guy with a six pack
