1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 usually have their id next to the
things that they do payment with once they have given you the id because
it's much easier to ask someone for their id then it just asks them for
their payment method you then say awesome you see it you take a picture
of it if it's on zoom because you need it for your stuff or if you're in
person you should take it from them and the reason you do this is
because it actually builds trust when you give it back right because it
means that like hey you have nothing to fear here i grabbed it from you
and i'm giving it back but it's much easier to grab someone's id than to
describe someone's credit card
