moment they close the moment the card goes through they're going to have
immediate remorse and so our goal is to totally reinforce the decision
personalize video from the next person be like hey and this is an
important point from an operational standpoint it's like hey I heard
you're trying to retire a wife I think that's amazing I hear they were
trying to get to ten thousand dollars a month I think you're going to
blow that away You're gonna do such a good job so just to give you a
heads up tomorrow it's me Tammy forgot to introduce myself and we're
going to be walking through XYZ so that we can help you get your your
wife retired as fast as possible cool really excited to see you I sent
you an email with all the details too see you tomorrow right and so now
they're like okay this is a legit company I just got you know I've just
got off the phone you know the phone thing and an hour later I get this
thing I'm like okay this is cool I feel good about this decision and
that's what we want them to think I feel good about this decision and
we're like great and then it decreases the cold feet and walkouts and
backups
