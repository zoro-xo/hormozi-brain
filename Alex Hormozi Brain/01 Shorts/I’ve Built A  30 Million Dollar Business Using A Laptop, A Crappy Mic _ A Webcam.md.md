1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 built a 30 million business using a
laptop you don't need to have a fancy setup or studio in order to be
successful i built my youtube channel off of a really crappy microphone
a webcam which you can see because at the end of the day all that really
matters is the substance the content do you believe in what you're
saying and is what you're saying valuable i think my entire setup right
now probably cost 2 000 in total including my computer that's what i do
maybe i'll be better in the future but as of right now i like simplicity
rather than complexity
