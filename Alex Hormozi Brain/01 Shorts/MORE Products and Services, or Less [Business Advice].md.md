1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 in a perfect world if everyone had

had a great infrastructure and all that stuff then yes the more products
and services you offer in theory you would make more money but we don't
live in that theoretical world most of the time and most small business
owners are not that good at operating and so in an effort to combat that
we have used this process over and over again and it has worked very

services zero to one million you sell one product one service one avatar
all right that's it one channel one product one avatar but once you're
going from one to you know one to three ish million and you're trying to
go to 10 you introduced the second product line
