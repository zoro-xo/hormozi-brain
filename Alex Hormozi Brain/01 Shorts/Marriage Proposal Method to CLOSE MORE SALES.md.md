1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 lawyers do not ask questions they do
not already know the answers to no guy most guys don't propose to
someone without already know the person's gonna say yes the take rate on
proposals is very high most girls say yes to a proposal and sales should
be the same way if you feel like you don't think you're going to close
this person do not pitch them continue to stay in this circle where you
are asking questions and reinstating and clarifying until you can
eventually find that piece that thread that was unexposed that you need
to pull to then get them to say that aha that's the issue and so from
this the three things that you should be using when you're closing is
you should be asking questions you should be restating what they said
and then once you've exhausted these pieces where it becomes obvious
that you need to move on the sale only at that point they'll say well
how do i work with you how does the program work they should be asking
you or you can at the very least say would you like to know the
programmers i think it might be a good fit for you at that point they
can give you permission to say yes you do not pitch the program until
you believe the person will say yes
