1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 my belief was that there's only three
objections that can come up on a sale one is i need decision maker the
second was i need to think about it and then third was price that's
pretty much what i preached for six seven years i now feel like i've
since learned a few more nuances to it that have helped me a lot and so
there's four that are required from the buyer and three that are
required from the seller and so that's what makes the seven okay and so
the four from the buyer is something that i learned from the software
world which they call band that's budget authority need timing but if
they do not have one of those four they cannot close the deal on the
flip side what the buyer needs from us is that they trust us for three
different things and this was different from what i used to believe do
they trust that this product is going to solve their needs in the way
that they want them to be solved because i mean you might want to lose
weight but you might not want to do surgery or you might want to lose
weight but you not might not want to exercise you might just want to
diet number one number two do i trust me the sales person because they
might believe that but not trust you which then influences whether
they're going to buy from you and then the third is whether they trust
the company whether it's a scam or legit or it's going to be here
