1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 billionaire friend gave me this piece
of investing advice that i've taken with me for life telling him about
some of the scripture stuff and some of these other things that are
going on i was like dude i feel like i'm going to miss out and he said
mistakes level rush decision and whenever you feel like you're missing
out you're probably missing out on the fall that's going to come i've
taken that as two different lessons for me number one is that if i'm in
a rush i slow down before i put money into something and number two is
that feeling of fomo of like oh my god i'm about to miss out is what
happens right before the crash that is one of the alarms i set off in my
brain to say you know what take an extra five seconds and really think
about this before you go all
