1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 offer is like the spark where we're
actually giving them exchange for their money and i think most
entrepreneurs who are starting out do it out of sequence and so they try
and fix step two or step three and they're like hey why is my copy bad
or why are my ads not performing when they're not starting with the very
first part of the process which is that that initial transaction right
and so a lot of my learnings around the offer came out of necessity
because i prefer to be dealing with tremendous demand and fixing
operational problems rather than trying to generate demand
