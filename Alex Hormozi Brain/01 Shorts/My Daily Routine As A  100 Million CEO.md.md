1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 can you consider me a 100 million
dollar ceo i get asked all the time what does a day look like as a 100
million dollar ceo the night before is actually where my day starts and
so before i go into the next day my days actually planned out to the
minute in terms of what projects am i going to do and i actually placed
those on my calendar so for me that's more effective than a list because
it gives me the constraint of time i know if i have a 10-minute task or
20-minute test i can place all those in my calendar and then i get
competitive against myself in terms of like the actual routine of the
day i wake up between four and five i go to bed between eight and ten 10
at the latest and i start working i have lunch in the middle of the day
which gets delivered to my door which is a jersey mic sub at this point
i work again and then we go out to dinner and then about every other day
i work out in the middle of the day because i run a split shift so
basically i work i work out that gives me a little bit of a boost and
then i do a second half and that's pretty much how i live
