1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 my favorite ways to get a prospect to
confront a decision when they say I need to think about it is this all
you have to ask back is no problem do you need two or three days or two
or three months to think about it the point is you want to exaggerate
the time frame based on what you sell by a huge amount so much that they
look at you look at you weird and you say right of course at the end of
the day you're going to make a decision based on these three things so
we might as well just make it today and if you're curious what those
three things are is one am I the person you want to do business with two
do you believe the product's gonna work and three is this the company
that you believe in that you think that we stand by our promises
