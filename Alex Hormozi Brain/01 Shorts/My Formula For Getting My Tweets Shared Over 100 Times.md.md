1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 my formula for getting my tweets shared
over 100 times i write out the entire tweet and then usually i'll end up
summarizing it at the end because i'll realize what i'm really trying to
say and then i'll delete everything above that and make that
consolidated statement the actual tweet
