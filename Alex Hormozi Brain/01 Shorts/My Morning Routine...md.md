1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 alex can you tell me what your routine
is can you tell me the millionaire routine the billionaire routine
whatever what i'm going to tell you is going to blow you away because
what everyone expects is that they add things to what they're currently
doing you look at your morning and think oh whatever he's doing i'm
going to add that into what i'm currently doing when the reality is most
of the people who are further ahead of you are just not doing things
that you are doing and so you need to look at the things they are not
spending time on that you are wasting your time on and so that means
that not necessarily doing your cold plunges your orange glasses and the
finger tissues and the affirmations in the morning and staring yourself
in the mirror and doing your pump up speech instead drink a cup of
coffee get to work and realize that the work is the thing that's going
to move forward and sometimes the doing needs to do
