1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 for the many people who ask me what are
my favorite books on sales and marketing my favorite book on sales is to
get out there and start selling because if you start selling and then
read a book on sales it will make far more sense to you than trying to
read a book on sales before you start selling because you won't even
know what they're talking about same thing with marketing right like if
you want to go and learn about marketing the best thing to do is start
learn how to run an ad you run an ad to a landing page and then start
getting some people who give you their contact information and then pick
up the phone and call them the easiest thing to do in my opinion is give
yourself a slush fund right give yourself a learning budget which is how
much am i willing to quote blow this month on failure so i can learn the
skills faster if you just say i'm willing to give 500 a month to
learning the skill then you don't have this like emotional attachment to
whether or not you crush it your first time because you're seeing this
500 a month investment it's truly that an investment in your education
your investment in trial and error rather than i bought this course for
copywriting i'm not a millionaire what's wrong right when in reality you
just have to get out there start doing it
