1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 i can change everything with one
decision this is one of my favorite sayings you're only one decision
away from changing your life forever and whenever i feel overwhelmed or
i feel like i'm decreasing like i feel powerless i feel like i have less
power than i want to have i always say this to myself because it's like
i can take one decision to change \[ \_\_ \] everything i mean like i
can drink a bottle of jack get in the car i can change everything with
one decision i can make a step to to invest in something i can buy
something i can invest in myself i can have a terrible conversation with
an amazing conversation with layla but just one decision and that's
always given me power but the thing is is that instead of changing our
lives we blame when i say blame i want you to think give power to
sources outside of our control and this is what you and this is what
your prospects and your customers are doing
