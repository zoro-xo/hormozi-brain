1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 give you the single hack that has made
me the most productive in my life and the nice thing is it actually
takes less time than everything else that's going to give you the
routine or productivity efficiency thing the way it works is you create
constraints and so a lot of us have you know like had to write a paper
and you had 30 days to write the paper and then the day before you write
it all in one day which means that if you had to write 30 papers in 30
days if you had the constraint and you give yourself a day for each of
them you would have 30xed your productivity and so the goal is by
creating constraints we increase our effectiveness per unit of time and
so rather than create to-do lists for yourself create to how long
something is going to take and then place them in sequence over your
week so that you get so much more done because you have that line that
means that when that line comes you have to stop
