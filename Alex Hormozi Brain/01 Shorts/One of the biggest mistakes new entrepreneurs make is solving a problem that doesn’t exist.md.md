1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 the biggest mistakes that i see the
newest entrepreneurs doing is they're solving a problem that doesn't
exist and they spend most their time doing this because if they have a
preference or because they think it's interesting not because it's what
the business needs and so our goal as entrepreneurs is to simply
identify what is the true constraint of the business at this moment and
then redirect all of our resources towards solving it so that we can
then de-bottleneck it and create the next constraint and at the end of
the day all businesses is moving from one constraint to the next and
moving along the pipeline until you go back to the beating and create
more demand
