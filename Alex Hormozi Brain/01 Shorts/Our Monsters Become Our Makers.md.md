1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 nobody likes a boring success story the
difference between a man with the potential to become a hero and a hero
is the circumstance that reveals it and in that way our monsters become
our makers and so i love this saying that the greater the monster the
greater the hero the trials that we go through end up becoming the
stories we tell just depends on what part of the story you're in right
now but understand this is not where the chapter ends and the beautiful
part about life is we get to write the ending
