of the decisions that we make are relevant for the ultimate outcome that
we're looking at and i think it's really trying to figure out where do i
have the most leverage and then being very patient on pulling that one
lever that one big move and most of the people that i see that are very
far in life have very low activity but when they do take an action they
go all in or they make a very significant bet on that action because
they know that they have limited bandwidth right so they put way more of
their time in thinking about the bet and so they can replace the
activity with the thought process because wealth is a relationship with
time people who have tremendous wealth have a mastery of time
