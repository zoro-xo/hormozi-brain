1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 you have to pay for the domain
acquisition.com was it expensive yeah it was 400 okay not that bad
actually i looked at marketing.com it was 5.6 million i told layla i
sent her a proposal i price anchored with marketing.com and then i was
like we could also get acquisition.com which is 400 she's like well that
seems much more reasonable the reason i ended up doing acquisition
wasn't even for the money is because the type of people and portfolio
companies that i am looking for use the word acquisition everyone knows
what the word marketing means people who are trying to scale their
companies talk about cost of acquisition it also had the double entendre
of we you know acquire stakes in the companies in addition to helping
with acquisition so i kind of like that component though yeah 400 i mean
it seems like a seal because five or six years ago zuckerberg bought
fb.com for like eight million dollars or something like that probably
also a great deal in retrospect yeah
