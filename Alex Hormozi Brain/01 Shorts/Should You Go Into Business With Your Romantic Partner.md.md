1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 i would not recommend going into
business with a romantic partner for most people i think most people are
just not good at most things and most people have really low levels of
self-awareness and are not good at picking partners or spouses you got
to get both right to make the whole thing work if twice the likelihood
of it failing but i do think that having a spouse as a partner is one of
those most magical things that's out there because there is no trust
like having your partner be your spouse i recommend it for those who
have the awareness to understand that you have to have aligned mission
of where you want to go align values of how you want to get there and
similar interests in day-to-day activities but complementary skill sets
and complementary interpersonal dynamics that make all of that work
otherwise you get conflicts you get disagreement you get people
overlapping people overstepping one another which ultimately can lead
things to unravel
