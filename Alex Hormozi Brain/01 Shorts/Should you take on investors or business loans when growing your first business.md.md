1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 thinking about taking on investors or
taking a business loan i think you shouldn't do either of those if it's
your first business instead i think you should do this you need to start
working with what you've got and learn how to hustle and make money
because realistically your first business is not going to be your last
business if you're going to be an entrepreneur for the long term ideally
you want to take really capital light businesses so service businesses
are examples of that where you're really just trading time for money but
you're going to learn a lot of these other skills and those tend to be
higher cash flow businesses that allow you to save up the money and
learn the skills so that if you do have an opportunity you want to go
after you'll have the capital and the mental resources to be able to do
it and win
