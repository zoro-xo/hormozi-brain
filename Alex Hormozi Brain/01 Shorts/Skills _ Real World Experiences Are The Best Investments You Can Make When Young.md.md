1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 everything that kids spend money on is
stupid with the exception of skills and real world experience like
nothing else matters cars where you live clothes you wear none of that
matters because if you buy a shoe for 300 bucks and you could have
bought a course on how to make tic tocs and sell that skill to 20
businesses that 300 becomes an income for at least the next decade right
whereas the 300 shoes are gonna eventually deteriorate and no longer be
cool so 12 months from now if you did the 300 course versus the 300
shoes which one of you can be better off
