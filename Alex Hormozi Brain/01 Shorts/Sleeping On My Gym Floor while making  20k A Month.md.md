1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 I was taking home about twenty thousand
dollars a month for my gym and I was still sleeping on the floor and
here's why I actually am very security driven I wanted to make sure that
I had a nest egg which I had pretty much blown in order to start this
business and so every month all I wanted to do is make sure that I
covered the rent of the business and then I had no employees at the time
for the first few months and so I did everything in the business so
everything above the rent was mine to keep and so every month as it went
up my profit went up but I just filed that all into savings because I
was so worried about something potentially happening and ultimately I
think it was the right call because I was able to make bigger decisions
later because of the savings I was able to have by not getting a place
and spending stuff on Furnishing and all that kind of jazz
