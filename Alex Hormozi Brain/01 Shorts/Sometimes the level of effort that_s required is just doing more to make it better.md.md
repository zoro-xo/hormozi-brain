1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 a lot of times people will do a tactic
and it won't be successful for them and so then they conclude that the
tact doesn't work and so it would be like somebody saying i wrote a book
and then no one bought it writing books doesn't work i rewrote this book
five times and on the fifth time it became the number one book in
marketing and sales on amazon's and sold over a hundred 000 copies i
wrote five versions of that book each time from scratch again to get
owned and honed and honed and honed more on the true value that it
needed to provide sometimes the level of effort that's required is just
doing more to make it better especially if you're looking at making long
form pieces or making the things that you want to set your brand on so
if you want to give that piece of free content aware you want to give
that lead magnet that thing that you want to give away to prospects
that's the thing that you're spending the most amount of time on because
it's probably the thing that 99 of people are going to consume and not
necessarily become buyers but 100 of your buyers are going to be
consuming and that's who you're making it for
