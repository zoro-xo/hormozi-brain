1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 it's rush the biggest mistake biggest
mistake that they make is that they're such a rush that they try a new
thing every 90 days and my fear is that they're going to be so many guys
who've been trying to make it big in 90 day sprints on the next new
thing that 10 years from now they think they're 90 days away when if
they just stuck with the same thing for 10 years it would be
unreasonable for them not to be exceptional because no one has
stick-to-it-ness and if you stick with it even if you suck you'll be
better than most people after a year and after 10 years you'll be almost
untouchable because no one sticks with any
