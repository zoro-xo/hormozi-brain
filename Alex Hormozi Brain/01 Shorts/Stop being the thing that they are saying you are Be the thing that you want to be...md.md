1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 i was 19 years old i had a terrible
reputation for sleeping around and being promiscuous and i came back
home for fall break and i felt terrible because i just felt like i'd
ruined my reputation in the first three months of college and so i
looked at my dad and i was like how do i get everyone to stop talking
about me like this like how do i get everyone to to respect me and
change how everyone's perceiving me and i was trying to figure out some
story or some marketing thing to like rebrand myself and he said son
stop being the thing that they're telling you are be the thing that you
want to be and then they will eventually catch up and it took two years
of stop being for eventually my reputation to turn around in that
community at the end of the day i thought it was something that i had to
say or something that i had to do or something that i had to prove but
it really was just proving to myself that i wasn't that person i
actually had to start walking the walk before the talk caught up
