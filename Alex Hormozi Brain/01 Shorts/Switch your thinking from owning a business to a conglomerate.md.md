1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 need to find other people who can own
their own p ls and become entrepreneurs within your company and what
happens is it becomes a shift from being a business to being a
conglomeration and so if you think about amazon they're not amazon's not
a business right it's a business of businesses it's a collection of
businesses that serve a purpose right and so i had to shift my thinking
in terms of how mine worked to we have a number of business units that
operate off of one shared spoke of shared services we've got it hr legal
finance all in the middle and then we've got profit drivers that drive
revenue across the business units and the people who drive those are
responsible and compensated based on the growth of their business line
or their product loan and so then you get people who can start making
300 grand 400 grand a year 500 grand a year if they crush it and they
should because otherwise they'll just start their own version of your
business
