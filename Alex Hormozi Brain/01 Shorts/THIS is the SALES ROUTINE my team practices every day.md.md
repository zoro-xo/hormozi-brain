1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 half of sales at least for a phone
sales person or zoom sales person is talking and the other half is
listening and so for half of the the 60 minutes in the morning they
spend reading the script out loud with the correct tonality and they
read it three times through without messing up if they mess up they go
to the top of it the second half they go through a call from the day
before from one of the guys and they either pick about what they did
well or they didn't do well where they missed something or a tonality
drop and they didn't attack her there was a belief pattern that they
didn't confront then blew up in the clothes like things like that we
have three loops that we practice one is about trusting me one is about
trusting the product and the other about trusting the company and so
based on the option they have we always agree with them be like totally
understand where you're coming from and then we ignore it and loop all
the way back around and ask again right and so it's really in theory you
could have infinite loops but usually constrained by time
