1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 there's a handful of big projects i
should be pushing right now that i'm basically just saying until the
book's done i'm not gonna be able to do it you don't set like hard
deadlines on like book completions or anything that's more just like a
hobby for free time if anything acquisition.com does not need the book
like the book is for me but either the book makes acquisition.com less
money i mean literally layla and i were having conversations about this
last night i was just saying like i just wanted to say thank you to her
because i know that there are things that i should be doing right now
that i'm not doing because i want to write this book i'm doing it for me
i was like thanks for giving me the space to do this because like why do
you have a business you have a business so that you can have the freedom
to have options and for me it's selfish i really like it and so i do it
