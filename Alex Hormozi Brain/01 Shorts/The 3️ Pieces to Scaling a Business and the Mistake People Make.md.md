1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 my belief is like the three pieces of
scaling that i adhere to is zero to a million is promotion one to ten
million is product ten to a hundred is people right and you can say well
if you have the right people you could yeah but that's not typically how
it actually happens right so you have to know enough promotion because
if you have nothing then you need to get people to find out right so you
have to start generating some traction once you get the traction and
this is where i think people mess up is they they get their first dollar
from promoting and then think i need to spend more dollars promoting the
whole point here is to get the product market fit and make sure that the
product is exceptional and we're getting virality from it people are
sharing it we're getting amazing reviews all of that stuff is happening
because then when we go back to really scaling we're going to get so
much more return on every dollar of advertising or media that we're
buying that it all makes the whole machine work whereas most people then
try and dump more promotion on top of it but the product isn't fixed
