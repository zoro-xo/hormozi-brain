1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 there's four kind of pillars of
literature there's speed which has two components one is the speed
between when they opt in when they get their first message and also
speed of response in general you need to be super fast on in terms of
opt-in to the first message also just if someone like let's say Susie Q
doesn't respond to through messages and then day two responds you might
have a five minute window where she's sitting in a karate practice
before she got there early where you might be able to have the
opportunity to have that interaction and if you're not there you miss it
then you have personalization which is do I talk to Susie different than
I talk to Dan right you would probably as a person so we want to make
sure that the machine can do that the third is volume volume of reach
out how many reach outs do we have typically people call the lead once
and then say the leads the leads are bad right the leads don't work the
fourth one that we discovered availability and it's actually the single
biggest predictor on throughput out of any of the four variables that
means that if you're a business and you're trying to grow your business
and you're only available to take new clients between 9 and 12 on
Fridays uh you're probably not going to grow because it's not convenient
