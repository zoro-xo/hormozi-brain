1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 there's five stages that happen for any
kind of behavioral change one is uninformed optimism right uh which is
where the grass is greener and you're like that looks exciting so
someone jumps into a new niche and they're like this is awesome dentists
make money i'm gonna go after dentists then they go to stage two which
is informed pessimism they now know that this is not nearly as cool as
they thought it was these guys have horrible front desks they're not
business acumen people they're painting they have to make decisions
they're over analyzing cool stage three is depression or determination
this is where like champions are made where people fall off which is
where most people fall off and so there's two paths from here path
number one which is what ninety percent of people do is they jump back
to stage one in a different niche and they start over again and they say
you know what it's going to be chiropractors chiropractors are the guys
it's totally different and they just continue this this rabbit hole and
and the false belief they have is i'm gonna do all three and see which
one works when in reality is you need to pick one and make it work
because all three can work but none of them can work together
