1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 i get asked all the time hey do i need
to like grow my social media if i'm selling social media services do i
need to be super jacked if i'm selling weight loss or fitness in terms
of like do i need to have walk the walk etc the answer is you should
know how to get there i ended up selling my gyms before i ended up
helping a lot of gym owners grow their businesses the fact that i didn't
have the gyms at the time in no way questioned my authority and my
ability to help them do it because what you need to articulate is not
have i done it but have i taken people just like you where you want to
go and how many times have i done that and if you can articulate depth
of the prospect then it doesn't matter whether you have a six-pack or
you're just in medium shape because at the end of the day if you've
taken 100 people who look just like them to where they want to go you're
credit worthy and more creditworthy than just some guy with a six-pack
