1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 there's only two ways you can get new
customers you can get it in a public form you can get in a private form
private forms mean one-on-one dms one-on-one cold calls one-on-one
emails it's basically a place where someone has to do a password or an
inbox to check stuff what's important is getting a personalized first
line so all you have to do is go to the person's profile look at the
most recent post and say hey i like this thing something specific about
it and then you put the rest of your offer and a key point of making the
response rate high if the easiest way to get going is say that you work
for free and they can pay you after you deliver a result it's the
easiest way to get people to say yes and then fill your clients up and
then if for some reason they don't want to convert into clients with you
you can still ask for the testimonial it also gives you the opportunity
to learn because you're probably not that good right now because you're
trying to get more clients and so it gives the opportunity to get better
and get testimonials so that when you do have enough testimonials and
enough skill you'll be able to charge for
