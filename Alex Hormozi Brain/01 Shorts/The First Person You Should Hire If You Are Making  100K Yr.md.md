1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 you're making a hundred thousand
dollars a year the first person you should be hiring is the person who
can replace the most of your time that you're actively doing and so
right now if you're making 100 grand it's probably because you have a
lot of fulfillment delivering client services or delivering products to
customers that piece should probably be the first piece the second piece
would probably be all the administrative work because that's not really
value ad it's just stuff that has to happen in the background and you
need to be driving sales and focusing on promoting the product for an
operational helper you can get a va for a few bucks an hour in terms of
delivery hub you can also get a va for a few bucks an hour depending on
the type of work and so i highly recommend outsourcing especially if
you're starting because it's lower risk and believe it or not those
people will be excited to work for you they'll show up on time because
they're going to support their entire family with that wage rather than
some entitled 17 year old
