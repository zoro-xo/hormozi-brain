1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 habits that have made me the most funny
waking up at 4 a.m and that is enabled by going to bed consistently at
the same time on weekdays and weekends from like four o'clock to nine
o'clock is like my time and that's where i really move the big projects
that are gonna make massive impact in the business what about like
concerts and like going out with people there's a reason really
high-level entrepreneurs live the way they do it is a choice i choose
that life you don't have to choose that just understand like that's your
trade-off and for me going out to dinner at 7 30 on friday is not
important to me all of my friends who are here in austin know that
they're gonna go out with alex and layla we're going to dinner at 5 45
so that we like get there receded we're eating by 6 15 and we can leave
by seven drive home by 7 30 and then we can wind down they know that
going into it it's just like if you don't want to play that then like
that's cool that it means that like our relationship isn't valuable
enough for you to eat dinner earlier and that's fine most people are
game to do that and they're like you know it's so nice being able to get
back at eight and like not ruin your routine i'm like yeah it's awesome
that's why we do
