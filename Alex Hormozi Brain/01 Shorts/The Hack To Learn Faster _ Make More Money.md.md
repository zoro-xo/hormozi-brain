1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 one thing that i do that helps me learn
faster and make more money when i buy a book i don't just buy one book i
buy two copies of the book i buy a digital book and i buy the audiobook
and i actually follow along with the words as i'm listening so i can
store it in my blend in two places and on top of that i actually read
faster because the audio keeps me moving at the right rate rather than
daydreaming and moving on so that's how i absorb way more information
than people normally do
