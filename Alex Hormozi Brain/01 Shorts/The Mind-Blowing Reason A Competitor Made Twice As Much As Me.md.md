so i was i was 24

and i was running ads in my space and i

was getting 15 to 20 to 1 returns in a

local market and i've been doing this

for like a year at this point so i was

like i felt pretty good about myself

and then there's this competitor who

moved into my area

and somehow we hopped on the phone and

uh

and he was just killing he was just

killing it he was doing like he was

selling more people than we were i was

like what the is this guy doing

right and he told me that he was

converting how many percent of his leads

is converting and i was converting two

and a half times

more leads than he was like i was he was

converting 10 i was converting 25

of my leads like i was killing it but i

was like what the like how is this even

possible

i mean i was spending 100 a day and he

was spending

500 a day and he would spend

15 000 and he would make 60

and keep 45 and i would spend three

and make you know whatever 25 or

whatever

it was and i you know i was making 22

and he was

he was making twice as much money as me

even though he was spending five times

as much

and that's when i was like wait none of

this matters like it's just about

who makes the most money

and so at some point you're gonna like

just everyone all your will get

less effective i'm just telling like it

will be less excuse me less efficient

in terms of spend but that's part of

scaling

you
