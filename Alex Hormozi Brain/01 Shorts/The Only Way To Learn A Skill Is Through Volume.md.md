1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 walked into my 18 year old neighbor
when he was taking a sales call and he hung up the call and i was like
you closed the deal i already knew he hadn't closed the deal i was like
no i think he said he's going to think about it he was like why don't
you think i'm closing deals and i was like dude have you heard you you
sound like a stoned 18 year old no one's gonna buy from you he's like
well how do i learn how to sell and i thought there for a second and i
was like dude just join my sales team we'll show you how to cold call
we'll show you how to close 12 months later kids making 200 000 a year
as a 19 year old and the thing is is it wasn't that sales didn't work or
the course that you had didn't work is that you actually have to learn
the skill and the only way to do that is through volume before we join
my company he was taking like one or two calls a day as soon as he
joined with us he was doing 200 a day 100 times the effort 100 times the
result
