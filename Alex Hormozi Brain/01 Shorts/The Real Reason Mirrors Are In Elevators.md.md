1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 i'll tell you the reason that mirrors
are in elevators and it's not what you think the reason they put them
there is that people started complaining about them being slow they
didn't like the music there's many things that people didn't like about
elevator rides right it's boring what they did is they put mirrors on
the walls and so then all of a sudden people are fixing their teeth
they're fixing their hair they're alone and they completely forget about
the music that's on the color of the elevator how long it takes because
they're so obsessed with themselves and that's the example of a logical
versus a psychological solution they can always use to approach a
problem
