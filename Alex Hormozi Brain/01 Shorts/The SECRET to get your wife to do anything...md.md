1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 explain to you how you can get your
wife to do whatever you want or get someone to give you money who you're
trying to sell by using reciprocity when you're in the persuasion
process and they're like i'm not really sure at that point the person
who gives first has the control because you get to control how you get
reciprocated too and so that means is if i want to go to a restaurant i
might give something to her earlier in the day that's lesser than the
restaurant later but it still feels like tit-for-tat because it's very
difficult to quantify an intangible like what is going to my restaurant
versus i took the trash out and so if i take the trash and i can say i'm
going to where i want to go for dinner it takes me five seconds to take
the trash out but we go to where i want to eat for two hours humans
can't quantify that well if you give first you get the upper hand and
you can do the same thing in sales
