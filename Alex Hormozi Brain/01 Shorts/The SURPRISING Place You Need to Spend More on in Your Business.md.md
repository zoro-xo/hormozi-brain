1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 spend more on marketing period this
might be crazy for you so i looked at our total lifetime spent on
marketing and our total uh dollars made and we have a 35 to 1 return on
our ad spend lifetime i should just spend more money but when i talk to
people who are smaller in their businesses they're afraid to spend money
getting people to make that first step is one of them the second one is
increasing their price the third one is paying for talent the best
people need to get paid like the best people and so thinkers need to pay
to be paid much more than you expect and doers need to get paid less
because a thinker should be able to make the decision for you and make
the right call in theory you should be able to make a better call than
you and so i don't know if you've ever like gone to a company and met an
employee and been like man this employee's freaking awesome like man if
i hit this person on my team i think the mistake that i've made i try to
turn a camry into a cadillac trying to push someone and empower someone
who does not have the skills or does not have the bandwidth or doesn't
have the attention to actually make good decisions
