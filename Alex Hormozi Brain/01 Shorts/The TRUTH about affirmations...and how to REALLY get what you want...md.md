1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 whole concept behind affirmations that
i do not like you know i'm a lion i'm a tiger i'm a whatever right just
saying them doesn't make them true unless you're a crazy person then
what we have to do is create something else which is evidence we have to
give ourselves evidence that we are this type of person in order to
become that but how do you have evidence that you are going to be this
person when you have none well it starts with activity it starts with
doing the stuff what you do literally becomes who you are which means
that we can actively change who we are by changing what we do we need to
take action in order to do that and so i think the simple and easiest
cue that we can use to change who we are to change character traits that
we find undesirable is to simply ask ourselves when we're confronted
with the decision what would this type of person do and then act in
accordance to that and i find it much simpler than having the lists and
having the the daily routines and the things like that because if you
are this type of person you will do the types of things that that type
of person would do
