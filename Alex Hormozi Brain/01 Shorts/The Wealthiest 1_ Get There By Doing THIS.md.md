so if you look at the the wealthiest

people in the world most of them

made their money in punctuated periods

of time

and so there are these these gaps of

arbitrage that get exposed for

that i mean that thing like no

opportunities forever right you get

these periods of time where there's

disproportionate return

on investment right kevin harrington

made all of his money because a certain

period of time

he was able to get infomercial time

eight hours a day for free

for three years they just had no one

they had no programming

so he literally ran infomercials for

eight hours a day on national television

for free and just killed it he had no

cost of acquisition he literally

sold for eight hours a day on national

television

and the majority of his money was made

from that and then the rest of his life

has been like

trying to find little pockets right mark

cuban made most of his thing on one sale

kevin o'leary yeah most of it on one

deal right and so

there are these arbitrage opportunities

that open up and they close and what we

have to do as entrepreneurs is

look at the skills that we need to have

so we have a full stack of skills so

that when that door opens

we can go all in and put everything on

black

you
