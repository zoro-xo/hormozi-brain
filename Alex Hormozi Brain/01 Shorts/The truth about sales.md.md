1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 people are really freaked out about the
idea of selling and so i think the first reframe is like you're not
selling you're helping someone make a decision that's going to help
themselves the number one predictor of good sales is conviction and so
fundamentally you have one person who should believe in something
another person who does not believe it yet and trust is the thing that
transfers that conviction fundamentally there's the two things you need
you need trust and need conviction most times sales people don't have
100 conviction also the idea of conviction as a binary is false so it's
not like i believe it or i don't believe it is to what extent do i
believe that's why like in terms of if i want to improve a sales team i
can do the drills which we do and that's like blocking tackling but the
thing that really juices the sales team is hearing the testimonials of
the people that they sold last week and what they're doing today and how
their lives have changed the thing is is like you can either trick
yourself into having the right tone or you can train yourself and i
think that it's much easier to trick yourself into it by just simply
believing because if you talk if you truly believe in the product you
will talk about it differently
