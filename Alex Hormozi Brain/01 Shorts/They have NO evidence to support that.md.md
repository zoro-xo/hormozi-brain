1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 a lot of marketers and sales people
like to talk about the internal thoughts that someone's had like first
they need awareness and then they need blah blah and then they and so
they're basically just make up they reverse engineer fictitious steps of
someone's mental thought process when they have no evidence to support
what someone's thinking at all and so i don't find it useful because
it's not useful like what are the things that are useful these are the
things that are observable that we can drive action towards that that we
create an outcome and then we have a feedback loop and so if we have
those things then we can move the variables and get closer to where
we're trying to go and the feelings although i recognize that they exist
it's just they're not helpful in trying to edit what our activities are
