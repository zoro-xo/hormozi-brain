1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 most common mistake entrepreneurs who
have small businesses make they believe that they should know how to do
everything better than everyone on their team and in the beginning that
is true oftentimes it's not necessarily correct but it's often true they
bring people in who don't know something they teach them everything they
have and then they say oh I need to find another person I have to bring
them in and teach them everything I have but what happens is a business
is always the accumulation of all the knowledge of everyone in the
business but if everyone learned everything from you then it means only
one brain is responsible for all the growth and at some point that brain
is going to cap out just depends where and then at the point that you
realize that you have to find people who are better than you at certain
things who know things that you don't know is the point where you'll be
able to unlock the leverage of growth of other smart people and that's
where recruiting to build the infrastructure transitions from one guy
with a genius and a thousand hands to a true Enterprise
