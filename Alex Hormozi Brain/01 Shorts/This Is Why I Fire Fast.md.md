1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 this is the exact moment I know when
I'm going to fire a salesperson having trained now probably 20 different
sales teams I've gotten pretty good at recognizing sales Talent
understanding the extent of how much training can improve someone the
window and time that I give people continues to shorten and any kind of
transactional sales that take let's say two weeks or less in order to
close the deal you should be able to tell relatively quickly in our
company if someone has a full sales cycle and hasn't closed the deal
they usually get let go and the reason for that is because the best
sales people I've ever had always close deals in that first time period
which means that this person is not going to be one of them and if I
already know that they're not going to be a star then I don't really
have a strong incentive to keep them because they're going to decrease
the average productivity of the team and so I want to always bring
people who are going to raise the bar not lower it and so that's why I
fire fast
