1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 the decrease in price never equates to
the corresponding increase in sales i'll give you one hard learned
example that i had my employees two years ago bitched and moaned about
how they thought we were too expensive soul crushing right because they
were like our churn is 15 month over month right it's terrible it's it's
it's yeah heartbreaking and we had been there for like a year they're
like i think we got to lower our price so we said we're going to go from
800 a week to 600 a week that was going to be our price drop we made
this big announcement right big announcement super excited not only that
we're going to give a discount and add coaching services on top so we're
going to give more for less just crazy over delivery first off i got
complaints from clients because they were upset that they had paid more
number two i cut my profit by 400 dollars a month and my churn remained
the same

2 00:01:00.000 --\> 00:02:00.000 wow so that series of employees lost me
five million dollars wow and you do not have to learn that lesson
