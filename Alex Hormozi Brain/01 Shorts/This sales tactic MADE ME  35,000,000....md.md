1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 sales tactic that has directly made
over 35 million dollars one day i sold a bunch of people into a new
program that was starting that was probably like 15 orientations deep
and i just headed no after no and finally i was sitting down and this
nice lady walked in and she had like a nice ring and a nice purse she
sits down i remember getting to the end of the presentation and i just
said hey so with the program you want chocolate or vanilla for your
protein and she was like which one do you like i was like chocolate she
was like all right i'll take one of those for the pre-workout do you
want to do kiwi or strawberry i i like the kiwi she was like okay i'll
do that one so i said do you want to just use the card you have on file
and she was like yeah that's fine and then i took these off the shelf
and i slid them over to her she grabbed them and she smiled and she
walked out of the facility and i made my first supplement sale and i was
like holy i didn't even talk at all about what these even did i just
simply asked her which one she wanted and the key was i didn't ask her
whether she wanted them i asked her which one she wanted that is when i
was introduced to the assumed close it is one of the strongest upsells
in all of business
