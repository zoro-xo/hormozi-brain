1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 how to sell your products and services
to more people than you could ever believe if you want to expand your
marketing it's not necessarily reaching new avatars but actually having
different people in the advertisements for your products and services
for example i look like this and push the audience that follows me looks
like this most times people subconsciously will recognize or identify
with people who look like them so if i were selling weight loss it's
ingrained in how people think i want to have a bigger brand and reach
more people even though eating less and working out more is going to
help any of these avatars what i need to do is have spokespeople who
represent the different demographics and psychographics that encompass
the entire audience and so in doing that i can actually expand my
marketplace expand the amount of people that i can reach without
actually changing my product or services
