1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 top five paying sales jobs you might
not have heard of so number one is you can look at selling solar some of
these best solar guys make two three four hundred thousand dollars a
year just going door-to-door selling solar panels number two is selling
pest control a lot of those guys can make 200 300 400 000 a year selling
pest control same thing with alarm systems and the reason is because
these have huge packages and long lifetime values the fourth one is you
can sell high ticket stuff so in general the higher the ticket of the
thing that you're selling the more money you get paid and here's the
beautiful thing it takes the same amount of time to sell something for a
million bucks as it takes to sell something for 100 bucks and it's just
the question of what kind of beliefs you have as a salesman whether or
not you can do it but sales is sales and so if you are going to be
selling you might as well sell the most expensive stuff
