1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 you don't know why places offer you a
bottle of water when you walk in the door it's not because they want you
to be better hydrated it's because they're trying to use reciprocity to
get you to buy stuff so a research study came out where what they did
was they had people hand strangers a can of coca-cola before asking them
to buy tickets to a raffle for charity the people who got a can of coke
bought twice as many raffle tickets as the people who did it and they
ran the study again and asked them whether they liked the person or not
and it turned out even if they didn't like the person at all the number
of raffle tickets that was purchased remained unchanged which means that
the power of reciprocity the power of giving first is so strong that
it'll compel people to buy things even from people they don't like and
that's what you should use in your own business for more videos like
this in the future go ahead and click follow and i'll see in the next
