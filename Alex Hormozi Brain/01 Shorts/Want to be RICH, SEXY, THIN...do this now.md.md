1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 vote with our dollars about the things
that we care about and if you show me what someone is spending their
money and their time out i can tell you what their future is if someone
is just really sticking hard i'm not sure it's a fit for me when you're
talking to somebody who's trying to lose weight and they're like i can't
afford a gym membership and you're like girl you're spending 200 bucks
on your nails and you've got a thousand dollar outfit on do you think
another thousand dollar outfit would make you look better or your high
school weight so this one is new identity and priorities when you have a
new identity you have new priorities and so you've had priorities that
are aligned with your old identity right there's the you that goes out
to you the drinks that you that does the blah blah blah spends money on
you shouldn't do spends time on you shouldn't be spending time on it and
there's the you that you want to be it's right now you can draw the line
in the sand and be like do you want to keep walking down the road that
you have been walking and if you don't then you have to step into new
identity and with that new identity comes through priorities
