1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 what do i do if i have no way of
practicing well i mean honestly when i when i want to do something what
i do is i buy a course about how to do something and then i follow the
course and do it so if i wanted to make a webinar then i bought a course
on making webinar and then i followed the course to make the webinar and
so i learned the skill while i was going through the course i would even
make the argument that you don't even truly learn it until you've
applied it how do you know if you read six books on sales and they have
different strategies which one is is the right one because you've never
tested it in the battlefield i think the biggest gains i've made have
been from investing in people who are above me to break my beliefs about
what was possible it's going to be up to you to acquire those skills and
most of the time acquiring those skills comes from doing them which
means you're going to suck for a while and i think just most people
aren't willing to try because they think that if they are perfect
they'll somehow not fail the first time which is stupid because even
when you're really good you're gonna fail so it's just people like
procrastinating and reading books about something that they haven't done
is a productive way of feeling accomplished without actually doing
anything
