1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 every 18 year old that's trying to
become a super billionaire first step is understanding that wealth is
not a number it's a ratio between how much you spend and how much you
earn and what you want to do is create a huge multiplier between how
much you earn and what you spend so if you spend 10 times less than what
you earn you are already wealthy because you have 10 years of living for
every one year that you earn which means if you earn for four years
you've got 40 years with the retirement already saved up for you so
think about it that way rather than trying to come up with some fake
number that you're never gonna hit
