1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 you can win every sale that's the
superpower and that's where you do make the most sales and this is what
we have to walk through with our prospects when you're looking at them
you have to be like i don't want you to buy i want you to decide for you
not for me i'll be the same either way right you're like i'm going to be
ripping in shape it's not going to change me but like it will change for
you so quick note on sales ethics and then we'll dive in helping someone
make a decision to help themselves does not mean buying from me that's a
reiteration you have to keep their goals at the center of the decision
and you should be happy if you can be happy when someone decides to own
the power and not work with you then the pressure around sales
disappears it evaporates there's no stake the stake is did i help them
that means that you can win every sale because you change the metric
you're measuring yourself by that's the superpower and that's where you
do make the most sales because you don't care about the sale because you
care about the person and the people pay the people who pay the most
attention so i call it paying attention they pay for it they pay for you
to pay attention rather than talking about yourself
