1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 health is not a number it's a ratio
between how much you spend and how much you earn and what you want to do
is create a huge multiplier between how much you earn and what you spend
so if you spend 10 times less than what you earn you are already wealthy

which means if you earn for four years you've got 40 years with the
retirement already saved up for you
