1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 here's why flying private is one of the
few things that i spend way too much money on most things you get used
to over time and you get accustomed to the luxury and it no longer
confers value to you but i'll tell you there's one thing that still
continues to provide value independent of how expensive it is that is
flying private flying private is actually really awesome it's mostly
because it just saves you time and a lot of energy because you literally
just roll your car up like you're parking at a store walk into the plane
go to where you're gonna go and there's a car that's waiting for you
right as you get off the plane with your stuff already packed literally
the only time of travel is the time that you were in the air and so what
it does is it takes the rest of the world and brings it closer to you
you can do business you get to where you want to go you can enjoy your
vacations way better ultimately if you have the ability to spend it it's
one of the few things that i think is worth the money
