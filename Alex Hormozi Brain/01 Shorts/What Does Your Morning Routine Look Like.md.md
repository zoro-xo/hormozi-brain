1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 the morning routine that no millionaire
wants to tell you i don't do cold plunges i don't put on yellow glasses
i don't wear finger toe shoes i don't go to a red light sauna i don't do
a gratitude journal i don't spend 90 minutes meditating i don't walk
outside barefoot i drink a cup of coffee and i get to work and the
reason all that stuff's a waste of time is because you're spending the
most productive time in your day not doing anything it's when you're
most creative when you have the most clarity of thought when your brain
is firing at the fastest and instead you're wasting it chanting
affirmations in the mirror
