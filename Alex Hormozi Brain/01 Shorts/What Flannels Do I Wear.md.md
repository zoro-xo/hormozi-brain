1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 so I get asked all the time what type
of flannel do I wear I wear Fair Day the reason I wear them is a couple
reasons one is that they're really stretchy and that's because I have an
odd shape beyond that in this rainbow of colors that I have is that
there's four temperature settings temperature setting one is I'm not
wearing it two is that I'm wearing it open with the sleeves up which is
the coolest setting the next warmest is I can roll it down and still
wear it open and then finally the hottest setting is I can button this
all the way up and now I've actually got more of like a winter Vibe and
that way if I can go between Outside Inside and so that is why I wear
these shirts check out my only capture that Layla got me for our
anniversary because it's hilarious she's the best
