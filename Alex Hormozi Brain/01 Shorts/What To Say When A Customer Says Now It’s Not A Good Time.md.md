1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 here's what i say when a prospect says
hey i'm too busy or now's not a good time let me wait till later to
start doing this thing i say listen let's be real there's always going
to be another thing that's coming up because now it's christmas then
it's new year's then it's easter then it's getting ready for spring and
there's always going to be another thing and then it's going to be
tuesday's donuts at the office at the end of the day it doesn't really
matter because the thing is is that the harder the season that you're
about to enter the more realistic it is that if we get you through that
you'll be able to encounter the next one because if you can only be
successful in perfect seasons then we already know that this is not
going to last for the long run and you said you want to do this for the
long term so if you want to make this change sustainable and you want to
make it for good we got to start now and we got to get through the
hardest period so that we know that you're going to stick with it for
good
