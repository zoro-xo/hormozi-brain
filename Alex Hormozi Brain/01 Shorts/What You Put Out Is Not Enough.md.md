1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 my wife was recording the internal
trainings that were going to be core to building the infrastructure in
our company and after two days of recording she sat down at the dinner
table and she was like babe i just don't feel like they're like as good
as they should be i sat there and i was like do them again she looked at
me i was like what do you expect everyone's going to judge you on how
good these are they might as well be great and you just got a whole
bunch of practice and so she went back and re-recorded all of them and
they ended up becoming the cornerstone of what built the infrastructure
that built the companies that we have and so a lot of times we think
that what we put out is good enough but there's that one extra mile of
effort that separates the people who are good enough and just fizzle and
never get big to the ones that become great and it's that extra mile
that makes all the difference
