1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 what you say if someone says that they
have to talk to their business partner they have to talk to their
husband or they have to talk to their wife before they make a decision
the first thing you do you say well what would happen if they said no if
they say i would do it anyways then boom you close the sale if they say
well i don't think i would do it if they said no then you ask why do you
think they'd be opposed to this now obviously they haven't even talked
to their spouse yet but they're going to give you the real reasons that
they're actually against it and then you can confront those and then if
they still don't want to say yes after confronting those decisions you
then rely on past agreements what that means is you say well do they
know that you're struggling with this problem yes are they happy that
you're struggling with the problem do they approve of the current
condition you're in that you're struggling they say no then why would
they be opposed to you fixing something they already don't approve of as
you rely on the past to get them to say yes and at the very end you say
hey at the end of the day sometimes it's better to ask for forgiveness
than permission right right and you close the deal
