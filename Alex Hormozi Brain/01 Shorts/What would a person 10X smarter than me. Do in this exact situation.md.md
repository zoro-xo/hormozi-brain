1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 give you the question that i ask myself
whenever i'm stuck in life what would a person 10 times smarter than me
do in this exact situation and the reason that this question is so
powerful for me is that it gets me outside of myself it gets me outside
of my own insecurities my own things that i kind of limit myself on and
instead i think what is this person this ideal version of myself or
someone way smarter than me somebody i look up to what would they look
down on my situation say this is what i would do and often times we have
the answer inside in this fictitious fake person that i've made up and
then the answer they give me is so much better than what i was trying to
give myself and then that's what i decided to do
