1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 the billionaire goal once you hit that
like what's next what would be next it's just continuing alex's boring
recipe for success let's just keep doing what's working um i would just
continue to do that i'm trying to design it so that every single party
that touches it benefits it's like an ecosystem of what i'm trying to
build so everybody who consumes all the content for free gets hopefully
value foreign access to the time that they're investing because that is
the real cost it's the time that you're investing and consuming the
content right and so if you get value for an excess of that then you
will be left better off and that's going to be 99.9 of people because
i'm not selling anything for the 0.1 percent of companies that we may
end up partnering with those companies will benefit because we'll be
able to directly invest in them and we'll help them grow the team that i
have within acquisition.com i'm recruiting the absolute best in the
world so we're talking about people who have uncapped earning potential
so they can make five hundred thousand a million two million dollars a
year five million dollars a year um within that structure so the people
who work for me will be able to make you know tremendous amounts of
income and create their own independent wealth
