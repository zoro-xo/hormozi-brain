1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 i have one non-negotiable that i do
every day on my road to a billion and it's just that i wake up at 4 a.m
every day and in the first three or four hours of my day i don't have
anything on there so that i can always move the big blocks forward and
at the end of the day if i look at a year everyone else who's competing
against me is still working in their business but if i wake up at 3
o'clock or four o'clock in the morning and i can work three or four
hours until eight o'clock or nine o'clock i get more done in that period
of time than most those guys are getting done in a week
