1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 i'm gonna tell you in 60 seconds why
you should never lower your prices the biggest mistake that i ever made
in my business is that i thought that in order to reduce my churn i
should lower my prices and provide more for less and this is what
happened i told every customer i had that i was going to cut my prices
by 25 and guess what happened nothing all i did was i lost five million
dollars of top line revenue which was five million dollars of bottom
line pricing power that was going into my pocket so it's a hundred
thousand dollars a week of profit that i lost by making this one
decision and so this is the lesson that i hope to pass to you is that
there's only one way that prices should go if you're selling services
and that's up
