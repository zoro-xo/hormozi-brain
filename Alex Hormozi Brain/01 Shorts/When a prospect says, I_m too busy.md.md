1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 raise your hand if you or your
prospects present with this distortion i'm busy it's not a good time
maybe in the future anyone deal with these this is a busy season for me
got lots of stuff going on as always we never disagree with prospects
because you're not in a fight totally got it do you want this to be
something that lasts for the long term that's a question you're like
yeah do you think that you're going to be busy again in the future well
yeah so you want this to last in the long run and you do think you're
going to be busy again in the future don't you think it'd be best to
start now when you are busy because if you learn how to do it when
you're busy you'll be able to do it forever i don't have any time in my
day you can't tell someone in a sale hey take out your phone take out
your hours by week pull it up oh look 22 hours on social media you've
got time so you say it differently you say you know what i had the same
issue and i used to play all the time about like how i didn't have time
to be successful do things i needed to do my wife got so sick and tired
of me saying this she pulled my phone out and she was like look i guess
i just found your time didn't i and you can say it that way and then the
prospect feels better it's not like oh i've got to overcome this one
thing and then we'll buy you got to keep peeling
