1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 taken home over a million dollars a
month for the last more than a half decade and i get asked the question
if that's true why are you so frugal but the reason why i'm so frugal is
because i've always had cash to reinvest when opportunities presented
themselves the biggest opportunity for me was always my business and my
own knowledge and so rather than spend money on things that had no
return i would save my shekels and i would spend money on mentorships i
spend money on private coaching i spend money on seminars and workshops
to learn skills that i didn't have and that's ultimately why i was able
to like move forward faster i don't get a lot of benefit from
consumption-based stuff if you eat out at a five-star restaurant every
night it costs maybe fifteen thousand dollars a month well what do you
do with the other nine hundred and eighty-five thousand at a certain
point money loses marginal utility meaning it doesn't actually confirm
more value to your life after a certain point at that point it just
becomes a measuring stick for god knows what but that's why i'm pretty
frugal because i just don't get a lot of enjoyment out of the things
that cost a lot of money
