1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 eating the same thing every day makes
me more money first off i have a shake and a bar for breakfast because
it's really easy and it takes no prep time for lunch i get a sandwich
that's delivered that has extra chicken on it and i eat half the bread
and the rest of it i toss and for dinner i just eat a pound of meat and
then i eat a ton of dessert and i do it that way because it takes me no
mental effort so that's always a staple it's always controlled and it's
always the same because i already have enough variables in my life what
i put in my mouth shouldn't be one of them
