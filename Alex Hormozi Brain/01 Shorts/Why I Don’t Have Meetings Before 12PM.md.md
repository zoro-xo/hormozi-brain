1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 before noon because my most productive
time for me personally is between four and noon and so i get all of my
big tasks especially my creative projects writing content before noon
afternoon is what i reserve for talking to customers talking to
employees team stuff because that's usually when i've gotten my creative
juice out i'm still 100 functional for those types of meetings but less
so for abstract thoughts and you know putting things together so for me
that's the optimal way to set up my day
