1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 fundamentals of wealth in general are
the people who learn how to employ leverage in as many ways as possible
within their life leverage on their time i have to put a little bit of
time to get way more back so if i can convince on in one hour to get a
hundred people to work for me then i get a hundred people's time based
on one hour of my time so it's leverage so it's about inputs and outputs
the greater the discrepancy between how much input i have to put in to
get bigger output is the more leverage i'm employing small amount of
input big amount of output
