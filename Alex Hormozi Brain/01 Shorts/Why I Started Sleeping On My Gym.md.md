1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 night before the lease was supposed to
get signed partner couldn't come up with half the money to do the gym
the night before I ended up assuming the entire gym how much did that
cost so it was supposed to be both we're gonna put 25 Grand in and I had
60. it went from me having some padding to notepadding so it was 50
Grand and I had 60. and so I had 10 000 left which is enough for two
months rent at that gym so I started sleeping at the gym because I
couldn't afford two rents I remember selling the entire first month and
making exactly 4 973 which is the exact amount of the rent and so then I
just watched it go back down to zero and I was like this sucks the next
month we made 10 grand the next month made 15 then 20 then 20 it was
like five grand a month all the way up to like 35 000 a month I started
hiring people and bringing people in and then by month like nine it was
all outsourced so I had the like a manager and some trainers and whatnot
