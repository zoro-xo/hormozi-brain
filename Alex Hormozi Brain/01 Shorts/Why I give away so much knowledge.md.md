1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 what's the objective for us the
objective is to document and share the best practices of building
world-class companies we do that by building world-class companies and
documenting it and then we share it and the key point of sharing is like
we share it so that everybody can have it and i just in my bones believe
that the only thing that makes the world better is entrepreneurial
businesses and so the more business owners we can equip with the skills
and lessons that were very difficult and painful for us to learn then
the more good businesses will be out there and even if none of them ever
work with us like we'll die and it won't matter and it's okay and we're
happy to just help people out and we're good with that if you like this
