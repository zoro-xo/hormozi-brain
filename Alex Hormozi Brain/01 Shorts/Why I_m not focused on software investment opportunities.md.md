1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 charlie munger and warren buffett like
those guys are my absolute heroes in terms of how they live their lives
and how they make decisions and how they think through things if you
look at the people who are billionaires right many of them create it
through software now what i feel like is not represented is the many
people who tried to create it with software and failed once you become
billionaires it's like vc if i bet on 50 one of them or two of them are
gonna hit it right but if you're the entrepreneur in the one your
success likelihood is far lower whereas i feel like if i invest the way
that i plan on investing i will have a vehicle that compounds capital at
a very high rate of return and i can diversify my risk and virtually
guarantee that i get there it's a risk analysis that's the overarching
reasoning behind it now that being said maybe in three years we'll get
on here and i'll be like you know what man i was full of i saw the
software opportunity and i crushed it
