1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 I'm a big believer in living on 10 of
your income and before you get triggered first you make more money the
second thing is that you spend basically as little as humanly possible
and to give you context to this the first place that I started renting
when I was making twenty thousand dollars a month in income I was
splitting a single bedroom in a seven bedroom house so I had seven
roommates and one of them lived in the exact bedroom with me so two
dudes and I had my mattress on the floor and it was the only thing that
I owed I believe in that because one when you've lived on nothing you
know that it doesn't make you any happier to have more you also know
that you were just as happy when you had nothing so then you don't have
the same risk and fear as you grew up which means you can take the risks
that are necessary to grow and third you have to learn the discipline of
delayed gratification if you immediately spend your check every month
you'll never learn the discipline of saying no now so that I can have
yes later
