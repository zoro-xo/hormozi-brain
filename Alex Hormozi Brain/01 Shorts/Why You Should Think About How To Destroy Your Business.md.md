1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 what could I do to destroy my business
that if I did this it would all stop for example if I stopped creating
free content that was better than everyone else in the marketplace I
would eventually stop getting new customers if I hired a team of people
that were not good then I would lose my reputation if I select customers
that are not going to be likely to be successful then I'm not going to
create the client outcomes and my reputation will suffer as a result
these anchors will change over time but the easiest way to discover them
is not to think what should I do to be successful but how few things
that have the biggest leverage could I do to destroy my business reverse
those and you'll find your competitive advantage
