1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 technology democratizes consumption and
consolidates production which means if you're the best in the world you
get to do it for everyone education is going to become or already has
been and will increase in its fragmentation so you'll have more niche
verticals and instead of having generalists which is what formal
education is based on liberal arts where you get like i've got english
and math and female studies and whatever right instead it's how to use
aaron b to make money how to drive uber and make money how to do amazon
fba there's more amazon sellers than there are almost pick a profession
that's out there in the united states and there are more individual
amazon sellers than there are almost of any subgroup of individual thing
but why isn't amazon or e-commerce a major in undergraduate it's a real
way of making money so i think that with this huge fragmentation
education hasn't hasn't gotten close to catching up but the demand for
high value skills has never been higher and so you have this huge amount
of demand for people who want to have skills so they can feed themselves
and provide value and then you have almost no supply
