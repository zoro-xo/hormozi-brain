1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 i did a deal with a guy and there was a
50 000 mess up on the invoice as in i was supposed to get 50 000 more
and my lawyer sent that guy's lawyer something and my guy messed it up
but the guy that i did the deal with had integrity and afterwards he
told me there was a mistake and he sent me the correct amount of money
and his lawyer said don't send it to him and he ended up firing them and
he left me with this one quote i'll share with you he said your name is
the only brand that you will take with you for the rest of your life it
compounds like any other investment you're guaranteed to hold it until
you die so invest in it accordingly
