1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 you should never buy or lease a car
what you should do instead is buy a car for five thousand dollars in
cash drive into the ground and still be able to sell it for five
thousand dollars three years later and drive it for free and the reason
i say that is because i had a million dollars in my bank account and i
still had a prius with a dent in the side door and a crack in the
windshield and when i pulled up to an event someone was like i thought
you were supposed to be rich and i said you should look at my bank
account not my car
