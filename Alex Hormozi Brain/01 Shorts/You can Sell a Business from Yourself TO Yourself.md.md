1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 you only have one outcome you have to
sell the business but it doesn't mean you have to have another acquirer
you can sell the business from yourself to yourself so if someone's
going to buy your business for a big amount of money they're not
actually going to pay for your business right they're going to put 30
down like you do for a house and then they're going to get a bank to
finance the rest right you have a house that you own 100 in cash you can
go to the bank and get the 70 mortgage on your house and just take the
money in the u.s at least tax-free and so the point is is that in my
mind two and a half years ago the only possible outcome that i could do
to get out of pain was to sell the thing that we build has to be
sellable that's just my conclusion it has to be sellable or you'll
eventually burn out if you make it sellable then it actually sits as an
asset on your personal net worth balance sheet and it continues to
provide cash flow
