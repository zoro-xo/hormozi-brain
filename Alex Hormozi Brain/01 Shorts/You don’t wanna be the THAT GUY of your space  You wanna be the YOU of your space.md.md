because a lot of people who are trying to like become influencers or
trying to create content they say i want to be like him or i want to
look like this or i want to be that guy of my space but the thing is
it's like you don't want to be the that guy of your space you just want
to be the you of your space because at the end of the day people just
believe in authenticity and authenticity is the alignment of three

believe is what you are truly saying and you're living in accordance
with that you will be authentic and the only way to do that is to just
be you
