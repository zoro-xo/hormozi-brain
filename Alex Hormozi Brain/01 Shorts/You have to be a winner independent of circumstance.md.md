1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 here's why morning routines will make
you poor at fragile and weak most people start doing a routine to feel
better and they feel better in the short term and then all of a sudden
they have to do that just to feel normal so what that means is instead
of it being a plus it becomes a crutch and so if as soon as you have a
crutch it means inherently you have weakness which is why you need a
crutch to begin with and so if you can eliminate routine as something
that you have to do but something that you choose to do and can live
without meaning if there's some reason that someday it gets interrupted
you don't say oh my day is ruined because i couldn't do my morning
routine you have to be a winner independent of circumstance because i
hope and pray that somebody that i'm competing against has a crutch and
i know that eventually over a long enough time horizon that crutch isn't
going to be there and they're going to stumble and we will be able to
crush them
