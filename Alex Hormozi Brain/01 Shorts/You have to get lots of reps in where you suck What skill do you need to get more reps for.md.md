1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 piece of sales advice i give my 18 year
old neighbor i walked in on my 18 year old neighbor when he was taking
his sales call i listened to him and he hung up the call and i was like
did you close the deal i already knew he hadn't closed the deal i was
like no i think he said he's going to think about it why don't you think
i'm closing deals and i was like dude have you heard you you sound like
a stoned 18 year old i was like no one's gonna buy from you he's like
dude you need to learn how to sell well how do i learn how to sell and i
thought there for a second just joined my sales team we'll show you how
to cold call we'll show you how to close 12 months later kids making 200
000 a year as a 19 year old you actually have to learn the skill and the
only way to do that is through volume before we join my company he was
taking like one or two calls a day as soon as he joined with us he was
doing 200 of that 100 times the effort hundred times the result have to
get lots of reps in where you suck so if you have the opportunity to go
and get lots of reps from somewhere sometimes it's great to be an
employee because those are the skills that build the foundation to do
what you want to do eventually
