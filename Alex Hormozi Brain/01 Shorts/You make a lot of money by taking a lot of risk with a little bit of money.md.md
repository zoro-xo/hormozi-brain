1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 heard millionaires have seven income
streams well the problem with that quote is that it confuses how they
made their money with how they invest their money and so it would be
just like saying hey billionaires fly private you should fly private too
to become a billionaire and so when you want to make the money you start
with one thing you focus you go all in and then once you've made the
money take the money and you spread it out because you make a lot of
money by taking a lot of risk with a little bit of money and you keep
money by making a little bit of risk with a lot of money
