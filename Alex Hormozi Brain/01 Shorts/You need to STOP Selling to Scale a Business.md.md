1 00:00:00.000 --\> 00:01:00.000 if you're going one to ten you can't
sell anymore right you need someone you need a team of people who are
selling on your behalf so it's you have to not only be able to sell you
have to teach people to sell you have to know how to recruit sales
people you have to know how to manage sales people you know how to send
salespeople and continue to get them performing right and that's a
different skill right we know how to sell how many people be like god i
close these people so easily and no one else can sound like me it's like
it feels good but you're still way poorer than somebody's got 20 sales
guys closing for so like just get over it like there are people who are
better than you at closing because all they're going to do all day is
close you still run a business so you got to stop selling it's my
opinion that 10 to 10 to 30ish is you have to give up the marketing you
have you really have to get beyond that and then at going 50 plus you
know 30 to 50 plus it's like you have to give up the leading which is
difficult
