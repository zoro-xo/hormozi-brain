1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:00.000
yo what's up everybody we are back with
the author of the brand new book 100
million offers
alex hermozy how to make offers so good
that people feel stupid saying no dude
you crushed that title um alex has been
on the podcast before you all likely
know who he is and he's had a massive
success and a relatively i guess you'd
say a short window of time and um you
know i'm visualizing this conversation
going two ways uh last time we spoke out
he used a term that really stuck with me
and it was you know the intent of
business is to break it in in terms of
growing it so quickly that internal
systems fall apart but in order to do
that we need a great offer
an irresistible offer a mafia offer i'm
an italian so i like using that term
love just to kind of
you know dive into some of the key
ingredients that
maybe even after writing the book uh
even having you know feedback from the
book so far you know what might people
still be missing that you know um i

2
00:01:00.000 --> 00:02:00.000
always feel like when i do a training
sometimes i'm like they still didn't get
that like
what are the things so crucial to the
offer
that uh we need you know we'll have to
always discuss and then in the second
half of the interview i'd love to talk
about how you scaled your organization
in terms of what did the first
team look like so that you could have
that hockey stick like growth and by the
way uh welcome back bro
thank you i appreciate it um
oh
so we have to put this from a bigger
picture perspective which is
you know if if we were to say something
simple like i will guarantee because i
know the audience is weight loss right
so i will guarantee that you will lose
this weight or i'll pay you twice as
much as you paid me right
very simple right how difficult would it
be for us to get clients probably not
that hard right and so that's on the
table the other extreme would be like
pain maybe get results maybe
doesn't really matter
as much people would say oh there's

3
00:02:00.000 --> 00:03:00.000
features benefit like if we're just if
we're boiling it down to you know brass
tacks that's what it is and so i think
that the book also just reflects a
personal in terms of how i
business
having demand general problems
would murder to him
i'd rather have
i always use this crate flow monetize
flow of action so
a crazy offer sell it for a lot of money
because it's so crazy um and then when i
can't handle it then i can choose to add
friction to process to you know get
fewer leads that are higher quality blah
blah blah right you add those pieces in
to then kind of turn the dials but if
you have no flow
it doesn't matter right and so i think a
lot of people
um
you know are trying to figure out the
the new sexy you know media platform
rather than just saying like
like nine times 99 times out of 100 when
we paint it has nothing to do with the
or the click you know with how we're
stuff it's just um read this
like this is horrible like would you
click on this i'm like i wouldn't click

4
00:03:00.000 --> 00:04:00.000
on this there's no pokemon issue i'm
like this just makes not clear right
and this isn't compelling this doesn't
move me it doesn't get people who you
click who otherwise wouldn't have which
is the point of having you know a grand
slam offer which is the the point of the
book um which is really just the first
thing you need to build an entire
business and that's why there's ten
books that are coming out this is like i
wrote the money model book through first
and then i was like ah shoot they need
lead gen which is the second books i
wrote that next i was like oh shoot they
actually if they want a good offer they
won't eat so i actually
the third so the book that everyone's
reading is actually the third book um
and so anyways uh in creating a valuable
after you right
i
kind of that i could
put buckets around these concepts right
and the way that that was over time
thinking about what makes this thing
the more value what are the things if if
weight loss will just use it again it's
like if liposuction solves the same

5
00:04:00.000 --> 00:05:00.000
problem as an and
that on weight loss why are they priced
differently like what are the components
that make up these particles oh um i
break it down four buckets overall so
the first
is how come that we were prompted become
compelling and
obvious but there are some
some trainers and fitness professionals
were talking about rotating their sacrum
by reasoning cruising rain
that's awesome but not really a huge
dream outcome but the reason i have that
as a as one of the first things is
making sure that the dream outcome is
aligned but also to to delineate
between uh like if i'm if i'm talking to
men
helping you make a million dollars
versus helping you be handsome
they're having a million dollars so like
whatever i'll buy the girl
and i don't
um and i say that
but
but if we have these two things then
the things that are going to be making a
million dollars is going to be by
baseline all categories of vehicles
worth more than something that would be

6
00:05:00.000 --> 00:06:00.000
like be handsome right
um but if we're talking so now we've
we've picked our vehicle or dream
outcome that we're going after so we'll
use weight loss then
why is liposuction you know
whatever 50 grand and and an ebook nine
dollars the variables so the second
perceived likelihood of achievement
which is when a prospect is about to is
about to make the purchase
what is their perceived likelihood that
this purchase is going to result in the
dream outcome that we are posing
the reality is at most times actually
relatively low people buy because
they're hoping that they'll achieve the
outcome but the more certain they are
the more values conferred to the problem
than ultimately the price and so i like
this simple example of with the
liposuction right if you have two
doctors one doctor is on his first ever
surgery he's never done a surgery before
he's fresh out of medical school and
believe it or not every doctor has had a
first surgery crazy and scary um whoever
that first person was right and then
you've got another doctor who's done 10
000 of these surgeries right
which

7
00:06:00.000 --> 00:07:00.000
uh of these am i going to who if you're
if you're the one who's going under the
knife which of these people would you be
willing to work for which of these would
you pay more for
you'd probably ask the first guy to pay
you
right
because it's for taking the chance right
and so even though
it'll probably take the first guy longer
so you actually have left more time with
them right with the first guy um
your perceived likelihood of achievement
is lower than with the second guy who's
going to take less time to do it because
he's done it so many times he's better
at it and so
there's a huge amount of value that's
conferred that has nothing to do with
the fact that e both of the services are
the same
and both deliver on the same dream
outcome
and so that's where you can see the
differences and that's why in the
beginning in marketing it's all about
you know showing social proof and all
that that increases likely but also the
other pieces of how we're solving the
problem right an ebook in and of itself
people perceive a lower likelihood of
achievement than if you said i'm going
to show up at your house and i'm going
to empty out your refrigerator and then

8
00:07:00.000 --> 00:08:00.000
fill it back up
right and i'm going to walk you to the
gym personally much higher perceived
likely of achievement right and so as a
result they're going to value it more
right so that's those are the first two
so what's the outcome what's the
perceived likelihood of achievement
now the second half the equation is
underneath so this is a fraction so you
got the top half and you got the bottom
half which has two other all right so
bucket number three
is what is the time delay all right so
between someone purchasing
the outcome what is the delay between
those two things and so for example as a
hypothetical just to illustrate the
concept if you were to click purchase on
that ebook and then all of a sudden you
have a six pack how incredibly viable
would that be it would be infinitely
valuable would be the number one fitness
company in the world right if that and
it's simply because the timeline even if
it were wildly painful right it would
still be
the the most valuable in the world
simply because of the function of time
you can get the same result for someone
in half the time it's the easiest way to
provide value in the marketplace and
time is the thing that people value more
than anything which is why netflix be
blockbuster which is why uber's beating

9
00:08:00.000 --> 00:09:00.000
taxis like all of these things are a
function of convenience right so our
goal is how can we make this happen
faster
now third i started the fourth excuse me
um
input here is uh
is effort and sacrifice right which are
two sides at the same point and so
effort are our actions our desired
actions are desirable actions that a
prospect is taking that they are no
longer um sorry sacrifice that they're
no longer going to be able to take as a
result of working with you so they might
be used to sleeping in they might be
used to margarita mondays and those are
sacrifices that they're no longer going
to be able to have
the effort that they're going to have is
the flip of that which is one of the
things they're gonna have to start doing
that they don't want to have to do that
they weren't doing before working with
you right and so we're looking at both
sides of the equation um our goal is to
decrease this right we want to decrease
the effort and or rather perceived
effort and decrease the perceived
sacrifice associated with the thing that
we're selling right and so
if you put all of these things together
you'd have this unbelievable thing like

10
00:09:00.000 --> 00:10:00.000
an ultimately valuable product would be
uh you know make tons and tons of money
right
uh the the perceived likelihood super
high like you're guaranteed to have it
happen right
the time delay is instant there's no
time delay as you think it happens
and the effort of sacrifice is zero
who do we know who's done something like
this
i'll tell you somebody who's done
something like this that has three out
of the four
okay
warren buffett said i'll make you [ __ ]
loads of money you won't have to do
anything
right at all
and into perceived likeness of
achievement i've been doing it for 30
years
yeah
you provided more value than ever
right he made very wealthy people more
money
the best
right and so when we're thinking about
whatever products we're selling if we
think about it through that framework
then we at least have a baseline to
start measuring and comparing value now
that's the framework that's the

11
00:10:00.000 --> 00:11:00.000
intellectual framework underneath of
that the how to it's like what do i do
with this right
the way that i i go through in the book
is you have to write down every single
problem that someone will have and you
have to do this in granular detail and
if this sounds like a four letter word
which has worked you're correct it is
work it's also work that your competitor
won't do which is why they'll stay
poured while you'll win right and so
you'll write down all of the problems
that your prospect experiences or even
perceives that they will experience and
so
tactically the easiest way to do this
that i have found is walk through the
customer journey from beginning to end
in excruciating detail so it's like
they're going to get off the phone with
you
they've now purchased
and so we've got every single step
between there
and them being in a bikini body 60
pounds lighter
a lot of steps
if we solve all that they perceive a
period of time
our product will be more valuable than
our competitors right and we'll also be
not able to be compared because we'll be
doing some other things
all right i'll use a simple example it's

12
00:11:00.000 --> 00:12:00.000
the first thing she might have to do
which is like go to the grocery right
which is the example i use in the book
so if you have to go to the grocery
store because she's to buy the groceries
that you're probably gonna have to buy
right there it's like well what grocery
stores am i gonna go to there's two of
them do i go to the healthy store do i
have to go to whole food like what am i
going to do when i go there where's the
stuff that i need right once i buy it
i'm going to have to pack it all up i'm
going to have to bring it back home
unload it and then i'm going to buy
stuff from my kids stuff and then i'm
going to have to cook and i'll have to
do meal prep which i'm right and so
there's all these steps right but if we
just put groceries
then a different framework called the
delivery cube which is six kind of big
things that you can do to solve how i
think through solving a problem right
so the the first thing let me see if i
can find this
page
so you can
please break my uh go for it if i'm if i
got it right here guys if you haven't
got your copy go grab it it's
outstanding uh you want to listen to it
on audible
every single day you'll get a new idea
to implement
uh you know anyway

13
00:12:00.000 --> 00:13:00.000
so here's the delivery cube right
and so
first is okay i have this problem like
grocery shopping i can solve this on a
one-on-one basis i can solve this on a
small group basis or i can solve this on
a one-to-many basis all right that's the
first framework i think through
the second framework i think through is
what level of effort is expected from
them is this gonna be a do-it-yourself
solution is it gonna be a done with you
solution or is it gonna be done for you
solution so with grocery shopping if i
had done for you solution it would be i
have a meal prep company that'll make
all your food one step below that might
be i have a preloaded instacart that has
all issues that you're going to need
right
i've done with you might be um i'm going
to walk with you through the grocery
store and so you can learn how to do
this and you feel like well i can't do
this because i'm remote that's fine do
you think there's another way you could
walk through the grocery store sure it's
time to
be available via text right just going
to get into some of the things i'm going
to show which is the third one which is
support do i want to provide tech
support do i want it to be chat support
do you want to do email support do i

14
00:13:00.000 --> 00:14:00.000
want to do zoom support do i want to do
phone support right and do i want to
have a premium level and a lower level
like how do i want to provide that right
and so you're like well how does that
apply to grocery stores well if you're
shopping and i say hey whenever you shop
you can text me and i'll and i'll always
respond within 30 seconds to tell you
that that's the right can of soup that
way i can decrease your anxiety by
making the right choices so it will
increase your perceived likelihood of
achieving the thing that we said we were
going to do right
the next is consumption so this is a
little bit more for the digital side
which is how do i want them to consume
the product right do i want to make
videos do i want to make audio do i want
to make it be ridden or do i want it to
be a live experience which is totally
different right you want to be live
yeah
um and then what's the speeding
convenience they can go grocery shopping
but they i'll only respond if they go
grocery shopping on thursdays so i make
myself available or i make a teammate
available only on thursdays or do i say
it's nine to five that we do that or do
i say it's 24 7 right and then what's
the speed of response am i responding in
five minutes or responding in 24 hours
am i responding in 30 seconds
instantaneously what's my response time
right
and then finally this is my favorite
question that i like to ask which is

15
00:14:00.000 --> 00:15:00.000
if and this is the the last one's really
more a hypothetical question um
i'll i'll say
so let's talk about the groceries then
i'll give you those those three
questions at the end um
if we have the
example
we have so many things that we can do
for this
person right we can do a live grocery
tour we got 101 we could do that in a
small group or we could do in a small
group of time record it
and then give them access to it we could
also do a group we could build an app or
an excel sheet that calculates grocery
them ahead of time or we already has all
of the stuff
pre-weighed out or whatever for them to
know what to buy or we could give them
an accountability buddy
pair go to the grocery store
that's or
thing right or like there's a million
things that i think is that most people
are just not creative they just look at
what everyone else is doing i guess i'll
do the same thing and then somehow
they're surprised the person that you
copied is broken
right
yeah it's brilliant so you just took one

16
00:15:00.000 --> 00:16:00.000
problem which is buying food and you
broke it down to
nutrition orientation recorded grocery
tour
bargaining grocery shopping training
buddy system i never even thought of
that to connect people in there but like
like you said
sky's the limit it's just like how can
we make this offer so good that it's
it's almost impossible to fail i think
in our last podcast we said something
like
it's so good that even people that
shouldn't be getting results are getting
results
that's a good one so okay so we talked
about the offer um i'd love for you just
to kind of touch on the cohort method i
found that
to be one of our most effective
strategies i know precision nutrition
did it for a while too i know you just
had ben pakulski uh or i think you guys
are doing something together but um
that's what we did with our hypertrophy
max program opened it closed it open to
close it and we just have these massive
surges every six months and new
customers and we lived off that for a
long time
i'm applying it now to even how we

17
00:16:00.000 --> 00:17:00.000
enroll members down to how many we have
available for the day based on how we
can enroll per week maybe just expand on
what this cohort method looks like
because i feel it's very effective to
probably a lot of people listening right
now we're doing high ticket coaching
so for everyone after you create the hot
the ultimate high value deliverable
right so we just we just expounded on
one problem the next problem's gonna be
cooking the food the next problem is
gonna be meal prepping the food and how
do you store it the next problem after
that's gonna be eating it and learning
how to eat out with friends and not mess
up right the next problem after that is
the problem after that is worrying that
you're gonna hurt yourself the next part
like there's all these problems that we
can solve and if that sounds tiring to
you
that's okay the point is is that if we
solve more problems
we will provide more value that's it
like entrepreneurs must solve problems
that's what we're doing and so we want
to take as many of these things and make
it so seamless and so lubricated of a
process and as an aside here
what do you think is more valuable right
if i say you just go to the grocery
store and text me
or
i made this entire training
that has a hundred videos in it that you

18
00:17:00.000 --> 00:18:00.000
can watch and it's a full training on
bargain shopping
obviously the first one right because
the actual thing in and of itself the
time delay the effort and sacrifice
associated with the actual deliverable
of the bonus rather than delivering is
so high it's not worth the the dream
outcome people don't want to well
obviously if i spend 100 hours of course
i'll be better at bargain shopping can
you give me the shortcut right and so
with each iteration of our products we
use we tend to make them shorter
everything gets shorter this book was
the fourth version of this book when i
like this is the fourth version full
rewrite that i made and every book got
shorter
it was less not more right so a lot of
people like time is still the most
valuable thing so once we have the
ultimate you know the core offer the the
valuable deliverable the other things
that we're doing are used to enhance the
desirability of that core offer so
that's going to be reversing risk
through guarantees
it's going to which i talk about four
different categories of guarantees that
you can give um the second is gonna be

19
00:18:00.000 --> 00:19:00.000
adding bonuses that are gonna solve my
new you know minor perceived problems um
that that will overcome obstacles in the
sale you don't need to present all these
things when you're selling someone you
present the op the bonus when the
obstacle occurs and then you ask again
right
the uh the third is scarcity which is a
function of quantity people say scarcity
and urgency is the same thing security
is a function of quantity how many how
many units do we have and then uh
urgency is a function of time what do i
need to buy buy right uh if you have to
do xyz by this date there's urgency and
there might not be any limit right i
could say hey i only have five of these
and i have no urgency but there's only
five right and as soon as they're sold
out there's done right that's a limited
edition and so now if you did both of
those things which is i only have five
and i'm closing it this friday then you
have both of those things layered on top
and so within the book we break down
each of those things and within urgency
and scarcity a lot of people like well
how do i do that without sounding scammy
there's tons of ways to do it without
signing scamming me because

20
00:19:00.000 --> 00:20:00.000
for everyone who's listening because i'm
assuming most people are listening to
this are coaches of some sort right
yes
then if i were to say hey i'm going to
send you a thousand clients tomorrow
can you handle them
of course not right but probably not
it's be unlikely that you can handle it
for most people especially if you have
an accountability based business or a
one-on-one component right
so if you can't even handle an unlimited
amount of customers why are we
pretending like we can so we should be
at least
advertising what our limit is so you
could probably hit like think about what
your realistic limit is your realistic
limit might be like five new clients a
week right and so if you know your limit
is five new clients a week just actually
cap it and say we only take five new
clients a week and now when you're on
the phone with someone you can say hey
yeah i have two clients already this
week we only have three more spots this
week right and it's it's completely
different because you can't handle more
anyways and you already decided that for
your own operational drag for within
your business because that's what your
operations can handle now later you can
revisit that and bump it once you you
know increase your on whatever right and

21
00:20:00.000 --> 00:21:00.000
so that is a way that you can add
scarcity legitimately without being
unethical right
[Music]
thanks amir
um the the second piece is uh uh and
we'll go the the thing that you were
talking about um with um
uh scarcity right and so
the the the three that i like to use
here um is number one you can have a
total business cap and this works really
well for high ticket right so if you're
saying hey i'm only going to take a
hundred total customers and once my
roster's at 100 i'm capping it right you
have implied scarcity there's also
social proof because if you're if you're
full then people already know that other
people value this too you can also tell
those people if they leave they can
never come back that that also creates a
fear of missing out right and so all
these things drive stick drive lifetime
value and decrease the uh purchasing
threshold people will buy more readily
because they don't want to miss out it's
much stronger to get people on fomo than
it is on desire for game all right
people people always like to hoard
scarce resources and if your slot is a
scarce resource which is our goal in

22
00:21:00.000 --> 00:22:00.000
positioning it that way then you'll get
more people to buy at higher prices
right yeah so number one is you're gonna
have a total business gap and over time
you can every quarter you could bump it
if you want to and create a waiting list
and i guarantee you sell them out like i
mean you just did you did it with um the
hybrid thing right like you had like
this is it and then we open the doors we
close them right so that's number one
number two um is a growth rate cap so
this is a cap on on rate it's a it's a
cap on speed right which is what i was
referencing earlier which is instead of
having a cap on the total business we
have a cap on how many we can take per
week right or per month or per whatever
right that's the second way you can add
in the scarcity the third way that you
can add the scarcity in is is having
cohorts in and of themselves so you can
make the argument that the five a week
is a cohort but most people think about
it that way so it's more like we we
we're gonna do a class um of 40 people
and we're going to start them all at the
same time and it actually tends to make
operations easier too because you can
take them all through the same
experience it tends to be easier in that
nature and then you'll see your sales
ramp up right as as the as the deadline

23
00:22:00.000 --> 00:23:00.000
starts approaching right
and so those are um those are the three
ways that you can add
that you can ethically add scarcity into
a business that you're not planning on
capping right besides the first one the
second two that i mentioned are things
that you don't need to cap you can still
have scarcity right yeah
alex we just um launched a new youtube
show called uh road to 275 and it's our
journey to 275 members
in the seven figure mastermind and i'm
thinking to myself i got the best
results in fitness when i documented my
journey and post photos so i'm like why
don't i do that in my business and i was
always scared to like put out how we're
actually doing
and i'm like why would i be scared of
that that's just extra accountability
for me that's the exact reason that will
make that will make us even more
successful so
you know we're using authentic marketing
we can literally bring on 25 a month
that is our capacity so each week we are
literally saying this is how many spots
we have or you do have to get on the
waiting list for next week and
it's just a simple message it's it's

24
00:23:00.000 --> 00:24:00.000
just and it's the truth so i love this
that's it it's true i'm like if i said
if i sense you know some of your clients
a hundred customers more they can't take
them like then why aren't we just
telling people we can't hit like it's
just we're just expressing something
that was already there
so the next one is urgency right
and so in urgency um there's cohort
based rolling urgency
right which is you can say that
if we're and this is how we like to do
it we do this a lot right which is
we always start people on mondays
and so if you sign up today you can
start in the next group but if you if
you don't then you have to wait until
the next one it's a different way of
saying the same thing because now we're
not saying it's based on a limit we're
saying it's based on time right like you
don't want to sign up by thursday
because otherwise you're going to miss
the cutoff for starting on monday
right and so by doing that now obviously
next week they can sign up but then
they're going to have to wait and some
people time delay they don't want to
wait and so they would rather it's going
to do it either way might as well start
now so you can start getting the
benefits right i love it yeah so we came
i came up with you know i was out for my
walk listening to your podcast i'm just
trying to think about how to streamline

25
00:24:00.000 --> 00:25:00.000
the operations i know we'll talk about
that a bit later but i'm like so our
coaches can have our coaches have
capacity for 40 clients per coach
so i'm like all right so right now our
capacity is 25 members a month but if we
can continue to tighten up our delivery
we can onboard 40 members a month that
makes not only just onboarding 40 a
month simpler but it's not every month i
know i have to bring on one new coach
one new coach and i can systematize that
now with when we start promoting process
of onboarding and then boom
um so it just makes everything easier
when you're operating from a clear
structure
totally 100
the second of the urgencies is rolling
seasonal urgency this is especially
valuable for a fitness base right so
you can run a promotion of some sort
right it could be new years it could be
valentine's day it could be sexy by
spring so that's the first three months
of the year right it could be you know
uh love you know special for april right
it doesn't matter the point is that you
can make up you know holiday hangover
lean by halloween big booty booty it

26
00:25:00.000 --> 00:26:00.000
doesn't really matter what the thing is
right um but as soon as you have a
promotion
you can use the arbitrary end date as
the end of the promotion now that end of
promotion right
you might change the flavor of whatever
the promotion is and it may be very it
may be identical in nature but it has a
different name because now it's the
valentine's day promotion and so you can
have urgency to end to book injure
months which i highly recommend which is
why every single gigantic fitness chain
that's private equity owned does this
they always have end of month you know
sales and specials so they can hit their
goal and they use last week of the month
they always do their most sales it's
because they know that scarcity
urgency uh drives deadlines drive
decisions right that's one of my little
things right so deadlines drive
decisions so if if we do this and we can
say that the promotion is ending
on the phone or in person we can say
that and that's completely true now
there's gonna be another promotion but
this promotion is ending and so it's
real genuine uh urgency that we are that
we are introducing in the sales process
to drive more decisions right

27
00:26:00.000 --> 00:27:00.000
and so anyways
there's a whole bunch more examples but
yeah
luckily here you touch on scarcity
urgency for resigns when people are
coming up to their you know 16 weeks you
know first phase first 12 weeks first 12
months of their program um that's a
question our members are you know asked
a lot of how to maximize maybe even
shift that might even be how your
business is structured but
you know how we how are we going to
maximize people renewing upgrading
so first things first you just never
want to resign people at the end of
their country that's like 101.
you resign people halfway to two-thirds
of the way through you never wait to the
end because you want them to already be
in and then not imagine it ending if
you're doing resigns at the end they
have already ended it and now you have
to resell them whereas if they're in the
middle or
you know half to two-thirds of the way
through they're still in the game it's
still an open loop and you just extend
the opening of the loop rather than loop
closes now reopen it
so that's 101.
i would never i've never done resigns

28
00:27:00.000 --> 00:28:00.000
actually near the end of the of the
contract time all right number one alex
does that just say hey is it starting to
plan anticipation for second phase third
phase four phase it's just continuing on
letting you know this is where you're at
in the customer journey based on this
being aboard your journey yeah this is
where you're at this is what we've
accomplished this is what we plan to do
let's be real you want to do more
because everybody wants to do more right
um it doesn't matter what business
you're in people want more of whatever
it is that you delivered
and then you add bonuses
scarcity urgency and you can add
scarcity to the bonuses you can add
urgency to the bonuses uh to get them to
resign you can add urgency around the
deal they'll get if they sign early
right rather than waiting yeah
so all of those things we can introduce
and then in terms of attacks super
tactical like if they
if they like the coach they have if i'm
with coach vince and vince is booked up
i'd be like vince is a waiting list if
you don't resign now i can't get by the
end of the contract that you're gonna
get
oh wow that's freaking brilliant i just

29
00:28:00.000 --> 00:29:00.000
want to tell you thank you that like
that is genius um i've never even
thought of like doing renewals way
earlier in the process that's genius but
it makes sense because it's when they're
in motion
and yeah that's you
it's that's just beautiful so
and then we can make them all sorts of
offers we've done this before rather
than teaching stuff
crazy it's nuts i'm the guy saying oh my
gosh how come i didn't think of that but
it's it's brilliant so with let's just
sit on that because i see some of my
members asking questions about that
i think a lot of people and i know
you're really hard on that screwing
around with the prices but how did you
do these resigns upsells without these
very hardcore about my pricing pricing
is not negotiable but promotions are
what we are
the pricing is decided upon ahead of
time
but if i'm going to give a discount it
has already been pre-determined
there's a difference like we will
absolutely give discounts for getting
for someone to resign or give some sort

30
00:29:00.000 --> 00:30:00.000
of incentive to sign early signing bonus
that kind of thing right we'll we'll do
the incentive but it's not that it's
negotiable it's this is what the early
signing incentive is do you want to do
it or do you want to pay more later and
maybe not get the coach you want
gotcha so let's just you're controlling
the narrative
so it's like you sign up today right uh
we're going to give we have this
exclusive thing that we only give to
people who do early bird right you're
going to get this urgency-based pricing
discount right and on top of that i'm
going to credit you an extra two months
on the back end of your contract for
free for taking the taking the promotion
which is how i give you your 20 off
that's beautiful i'm not even giving
i'm not even giving a discount i said
two months are tacked on the end and if
they see all the payments and that's
contingent on you doing all your
payments on time if you're if you have
any contracting issues or any payment
things the bonus is gone
i love it that's brilliant um we have
different levels other coaches here have
different levels too what are some
techniques for

31
00:30:00.000 --> 00:31:00.000
ascending people to the next level and
creating a culture of ascension so one
thing that we're doing now in the
seven-figure mastermind is we have a an
elite program a fifty thousand fifty
thousand dollar program with just uh
coach corby and i and we now have
something called the kick in the ass
reward so for people that graduate from
seven figure mastermind to elite 101 in
the first 90 days i'd love to hear your
thoughts you can put me on the hot seat
here we put that towards their
original 50k so that they're going to do
something they're already planning on
doing but we're now going to collect an
extra 35 30k sort of
sort of thing
in the first 90 days how do you i think
you can you have a term for that is it
upsell the down sell or down sell the
upsell
yeah
so i it's called down sell the upsell
because
and this goes for any kind of contract
you guys are selling so if you're
selling term
human beings in general understand
priced decently well don't understand
[ __ ] about terms right and so this is

32
00:31:00.000 --> 00:32:00.000
this is a really it's interesting one
like i'm buying a business i'd be like
what's more important to your price or
terms right they're gonna say price and
then i'm gonna be like well cool i can
do a zillion things on terms right
so it's like if i'm so here's a funny
one just just to illustrate the example
if i say hey vince uh i wanna buy your
house real estate market you know what
do you want for what's more important
you might say price just play along
right so let's say that you're like well
okay cool well what is the price you
want maybe you give me 10 above market
right i'm like cool i guarantee you i'll
pay you that price as long as we can do
my terms fair enough cool
cool i'm going to finance it over 30
years and you're going to sell or
finance it
right and then i'm going to take
ownership of your house and then i'm
going to rent it out and i never even
put money in the deal
right
so
i'm just saying that as an illustration
that terms matter and so it's called
upselling the down sell or dialing the
upsell whatever right is that
i like to
have a higher ticket contract that's
extended over a longer term of time
because if your current let's say front
end pro i don't know the pricing but

33
00:32:00.000 --> 00:33:00.000
just play with me so let's say it's 12k
for 12 weeks right so it's 12k for 12
weeks which means people are paying a
thousand dollars a week is what they're
currently paying and so if i say hey
next thing is a year
right
and you're going to pay half as much as
you are now and you're going to get more
than you're currently getting do you
want to do it they're going to say sure
but the term
is now a
you know it's it's four times the
duration so if they pay half the price
they're still paying twice as much ah
gotcha
gotcha yeah
so you've got them signed up for say you
know 16 week program or something
they're paying a certain amount and then
you cut into half pitch instead of
renewing them for 12 months it's for two
or three years or something yeah yeah
and this is like if we did if the first
thing was 12 months then yeah the next
thing would be 12 or 24 months or or
whatever
that's freaking beautiful wow
i all right guys class is over you guys
want us to shut this down or what
alex i think you could go hit the gym
man
just you probably already lifted today

34
00:33:00.000 --> 00:34:00.000
um that's brilliant okay um let's touch
on guarantees so i want to make sure
we've tried this in the past i don't
sometimes you can get into some muddy
waters here so maybe just like your best
practices on guarantees especially when
you're you know you know offering a 2x
guarantee on you know
selling the coaches you're making money
just kind of ways to do the guarantee to
not get yourself in muddy waters where
you're trying also attracting really low
quality leads i don't like selling broke
people i don't like now i was broke when
i hired my first business coach if they
didn't have you know terms i wouldn't
have been able to start so i do like
offering credit and some form of
incentive but just let's talk about i
see some people putting out guarantees
i'm like that's going to be a nightmare
so some best practices on that
so all right so let's talk
we'll go for top down so from the top
if i were to say you're going to lose
100 pounds right you're going to lose
100 pounds and uh i guarantee that you
do that or i'll give you all your money

35
00:34:00.000 --> 00:35:00.000
back
[Music]
or i'll help you hit your goal or i'll
give you your money back right it
doesn't matter how long it takes to get
there
you probably have no problem with it
right and the other side is pay me and
we'll see what happens right
there is a space between these two
extremes that you can pick it's just
that most people are here so it's like
let's take a cup let's take a handful of
steps or start here and then just peel
back as few pieces as we can to stay as
close to this total risk reversal as
possible right
and so there are so in if we were just
to do that you would have a more
compelling offer you'd be able to sell
for more money
if i were to sell a program that i have
no guarantee versus the program that i
do have a guarantee you can sell that
for more money
because it's guaranteed the perceived
likelihood goes up is more viable
truly more valued we changed nothing
yeah except the guarantee how we wrapped
and positioned it right so one we can
raise the price
um number two we're gonna have way more
people buy so we have more buyers at
higher prices that's a double force

36
00:35:00.000 --> 00:36:00.000
multiplier in terms of how much money
you make and you're probably not going
to have any legitimacy because when you
make that offer everyone comes right so
that's the extreme over here
so
underneath of that there's four types of
guarantees that you can give all right
the first type of guarantee
is uh an unconditional guarantee it's
good old-fashioned what i what i just
said which is no questions asked
you ask for your money back it's yours
now you can also attach a different term
to that so i'm trying to get two in the
weeds because i have a whole chapter on
this but
you could say i'm gonna give you a 30
day unconditional on a six-month program
so it's like hey buy it and
you guys want a big sales hack is
everybody good for a big sales hack is
that all right let's do it another go
buy your book after go for it right
so you say hey i'm not asking you to
make a decision today
what i am asking you to do is make an
informed decision which you can only do
on the inside of the program just like
you wouldn't buy a car without test
driving you wouldn't buy a house without
walking it right so i'm not asking you
to buy this program without actually
having done it so

37
00:36:00.000 --> 00:37:00.000
all i want you to do is give it a shot
which is start and then if the end of
the 30 days for any reason whatsoever
you don't like the smell of my my breath
even though we're virtual you don't like
the smell of my breath virtually i'll
give you your money back all right
that's how confident i am and the only
reason i can make guarantees like that
is because we're a legitimate business
and i know that we're gonna be able to
buy the results far in excess of what
you've experienced in the past all right
that's a 30 day it might be a 12 month
program
but once they pass 30 days it's done but
you're going to sell way more people
like that and at higher prices
right
so that's one
you could do it for the whole program or
you could do it for the shorter term
it's up to you so that's type of
guarantee number one
type of guarantee number two
is a conditional guarantee which is and
with conditional guarantees i prefer to
make them way more like grandiose right
so if it's uh you know i'll help you
lose whatever the the poundage is
right by x period of time and then a
guarantee has two pieces to it which is
you will get x

38
00:37:00.000 --> 00:38:00.000
by y
or else
right so you're going to have this
outcome by this time or i will so what
the or i will is the thing that gives
guaranteed teeth right most people don't
have good guarantees like no teeth on
the guarantees you see and this is
honestly what so vince when you were
saying a lot of people are putting
guarantees out there most of them have
guarantees that have no teeth so i could
say hey vince i guarantee i'll get you
100 million dollars right
if you pay me
and then you'll be like or what
right
i'd be like or you'll continue to have
access to my materials
i mean it's something
it'll get a lot of clicks on the
headline but from an actual like teeth
on the on the on the guarantee it's not
as compelling right yeah but if they
didn't get results in the first place
why wouldn't they want to keep it
anyways
that's my point so it doesn't actually
reverse the risk exactly yeah yeah so
the strength of a guarantee is
proportional to the amount of risk it
reverses
so you getting continued access i can
use the headline of the guarantee which

39
00:38:00.000 --> 00:39:00.000
has some value right but the the soup
and nuts of it has no teeth the more
teeth you give to it the more value
it'll be so
conditional guarantees you could stack
the guarantees you could have it
unconditional for this and then a
conditional for a longer period of time
all right and then you can guarantee
around the outcome which is i want to
help you lose x weight or it could be
that you're going to establish z habit
or it's that you're going to you know
whatever the thing that you're selling
right
and then uh
i'll do that and i'll give you twice
your money back if you don't lose this
amount of weight if right and this is
what they have to do as long as as long
as you attend all of the the things and
you send me pictures of your food and
you check into the gym every day that
you need you know whatever the thing is
right and so
all these little dials here because
on the conditions the more you have the
less it reverses risk
for them
so you really want to be as selective as
possible and really pare down to like
what are the absolute necessities that

40
00:39:00.000 --> 00:40:00.000
someone has to do
now if you want to be a smart cookie
about it what you can do is look at the
customers that you have right now who
are successful who ascended and who
bought your next thing and renewed and
resigned and say what did these people
experience
in their first 90 days
what did they have happened or even
their first 30 days that they have
happened that were indicators or leading
indicators that they would ascend and
stick and so then you build your
conditions around the things that create
ideal clients
so i know if someone sends me their
meals every day for 30 days the likely
that that person ascends
is 90
then my conditional guarantee is going
to be that i will guarantee this or
twice your money back as long as you
send me this for the first 30 days
because i know that if i get you that
happen the first 30 days you're going to
keep doing it
yeah 100 yeah so you need to know your
milestone yeah
yeah i love it it goes back it goes back
to the offer now and having you know
what we talked about our last podcast

41
00:40:00.000 --> 00:41:00.000
one-way play you know having all right
step one you need to post this step two
you know your blunt post step three 25
messages a day step it's if you don't do
that
the only next thing i need to do is like
in the gym now i just need to sleep
lifting
right now i just have to look at your
conversations now i just have to look at
the post but i know the steps are right
so i love it these analogies are so like
you know parallel with how you lift in
the gym like okay you're dating
deadlifts and your body's not changing
all right now we have to look at your
technique so oh that's fixed now the
body's going to change same thing with
the business which is why when you can
reverse engineer those steps you can
make those guarantees because you've
simplified your your process your method
so
it is my opinion that you should
guarantee that scares you
more than the customers yeah
yeah and then figure out what's wrong
with your business model and your
fulfillment that makes you scared that's
beautiful

42
00:41:00.000 --> 00:42:00.000
use the guarantee is that as the as the
as the fear driver to get you to fix
your business so that the service is on
par so that you can fulfill those
guarantees so
unconditional
conditional you can stack the two
together you can also have multiple
conditional guarantees you could say i'm
going to guarantee that you'll hit 10
pounds by by 60 days and i guarantee you
you hit 20 pounds by 90 days or uh you
know that first period comes free
i'll credit back to you right
sorry go ahead sorry you could say yeah
credit like and just for everybody here
you can give a guarantee and not have to
give money back and give money as credit
or extended time like there's other
things you can give besides money money
is just the least creative thing you can
do
paper yes
yeah everything's reinforced you know i
guess this might be a question in the
weeds here but you know if we're gonna
ask you but if you've got you here you
know reinforcement of you know
this i guess this is
you know of course you need to reinforce
it this is probably a dedicated role to
you know if somebody's saying hey they
get results i mean the whole idea is to

43
00:42:00.000 --> 00:43:00.000
put this stuff in motion and then to
find out issues as it shows up
what would you say to somebody who's
afraid to like me kind of addressed it
you need a better program you probably
need somebody dedicated to helping these
red light clients etc i i can i can hear
people's thoughts they're fearful of
okay i'm gonna put this in motion but
what if this creates a customer service
nightmare it's kind of like the point
though it's like then you go fix those
problems too
yeah and then you have this crazy front
end and then you fix the problems on the
back and you have a business you're
making 10 hours more money
i love it all right uh with some time we
have left here um anything else you want
to talk about on offer that you get
asked there i might maybe i missed
asking you that just
will make this the mafia offer well the
other two types of guarantees you have
anti-guarantees which is we're looking
for the type of like where and you can
do this which is all sales are final
which is we're looking for the type of
people that don't want guarantees we're
looking we want to do the type of work
and we're going to be investing a
tremendous amount of time in you and if
that's if that sounds scary then you can
definitely go buy an e-book for nine
bucks and not get results which is

44
00:43:00.000 --> 00:44:00.000
which has gotten you really far
right i want you to know that you're
gonna i know i want you to know that
and i want you to feel this
invested
you have to
go all in
that's going to take wrong with that
it's just
whatever your opinion is if you don't
refunds
you should hit
when you don't offer refunds
totally closed so many times i see
salesman i'm sure you have too they they
facet clothes
right they're like oh yeah i mean if
there's any issues you know like either
[ __ ] have a guarantee or don't and
own it right own it
and then
the fourth one is a performance offer um
which is based on some sort of thing
that's supposed to happen and it's
proportional so it's like hey
here's the deal uh
you pay me a hundred bucks for every
pound that's it you need you lose three
thousand pounds i said three thousand
pounds
thirty pounds right uh you know you pay

45
00:44:00.000 --> 00:45:00.000
me you pay me three grand
right
that's interesting wow we there's so
many different creative ways to do i
just love what you're saying this is all
different that my first business coach
got me on the anti-guarantee by the way
i remember when i was uh
25 uh it was 7 500
6 months it was actually with corey
rudolph's internet marketing center i
bought his dvds 300 bucks they called me
up on the phone they asked me how i was
doing i said i know what i want to do
the rest of my life but i'm overwhelmed
and he said uh all right would you want
some help i said sure so i had to put it
on two credit cards and i uh actually
did the follow me they had to follow me
uh follow up with me and i said when i
go on the uh follow-up call i got him
i'm gonna tell him if you can guarantee
me an extra alex get this
my grand ambition when i started was an
extra three to four thousand dollars a
month so i said if you can help me do
that i'm in
so when i said that to him he laughed
and i said what are you laughing at you
know if you can guarantee this i'm in
and he said vince we don't do guarantees
over here i said you know what do you

46
00:45:00.000 --> 00:46:00.000
mean he's like well
guaranteeing our time but we don't know
what you're doing with your time so
there's no guarantees
and that that was my first introduction
to the whole concept that success is
your responsibility and your duty and he
wasn't doing me a favor um or i wasn't
doing him a favor by becoming a client
he was doing me a favor of offering his
services to help me so i love that
auntie guarantee she wanted to share
that
yeah
so that yeah i mean the book goes into a
ton of detail and all these things um
but yeah big picture
those are those are the elements
scarcity urgency
we don't even talk about bonuses but
security urgency guarantees bonuses each
of them has depth and then the actual
offer itself and then which things
should be bonuses which things should be
core offers and how you position it how
you should
play that with the numbers of people how
you add in the rolling cohorts all that
kind of stuff so you can ultimately sell
more people at higher prices
awesome well hey maybe just for a few
final minutes alex you know now this is
what's going to break the business maybe
just start giving some insights on how
to build your first team there's that

47
00:46:00.000 --> 00:47:00.000
shows up for a lot of uh entrepreneurs
business owners whatever they call
themselves these days um
first person you're gonna hire like what
does that first team of four or five
people look like in just your process of
letting go of control delegating
responsibility setting standards of
performance
in order to you know free up your time
to keep scaling
yeah so
they're just they're miniature big
businesses you know i mean so most
entrepreneur when you're when you're
starting
because you have to learn 100 roles and
do them all fractionally
and then over time as the business grows
you have almost enough work for a
full-time person right and it might
scare you because you're like well i was
running this business on my own so if i
have one person then i should be able to
have they should be able to do the same
as me except it doesn't work that way so
you probably need to hire five people to
do the same amount with you because
you're going to do one fraction of the
thing that you're doing and so
i always outsource in reverse order of
market
so if i think that right now if you look

48
00:47:00.000 --> 00:48:00.000
at so the easiest way to do this is do a
time study so you get a sheet of shell
paper
and put it in 15 minute blocks and then
you look at what you're doing with your
time because most people are massively
disorganized and if you're like that
sounds like it'll take time i promise
you you'll triple your productivity when
you measure what you're actually doing
right because you'll want to brag to
yourself
and like you're really productive and
then by doing that you'll actually get a
lot more done so
you'll never waste time when you do
timestamps so you do a time study and
then what you do is you block it into
like what type of work it is and then
you can describe the value to replace
that job so if you're doing
administrative work that's 15 bucks an
hour if you're doing
you know customer success which would be
responding to
is this the right brand of food and hey
i'm stuck with my weight what do i do
again probably 15 bucks an hour like not
a lot of skill is required there right
um
sales higher value marketing higher
value ceo making big decisions strategy
decisions higher value
product so making all the higher value

49
00:48:00.000 --> 00:49:00.000
so what we're doing is first it'd
probably be
front line support or fulfillment right
next might be administrative you can
swap those they're relatively equivalent
i think
early on it would be better than some
sort of operations person so some sort
of administrative help kind of like an
ex-office manager is a great one to look
at who you know somebody who ran two
densest offices and then wants to work
remote like those are great options
because they're they're swiss army
knives they're used to doing lots of
little things
so that would probably because it'll
that person will give you a lot of time
back they can also help you with your
personal life which still takes very
real time for you right so um that would
probably be number one number two would
be customer success um and then
number three would probably be something
around product
um
number four would be sales
and then i might have to hire i probably
i'd probably get a vendor for you know
bookkeeping and and finances and things
like that so some of these things can be
vendors um that would probably be the
first core you know four or five

50
00:49:00.000 --> 00:50:00.000
you're still gonna be running you're
still gonna probably be running
marketing and running the ads and
making the videos and making the pages
because that's gonna be your thing
um
what's your thoughts on going on you
know building an internal team where you
know what role is like
you know we i just recently discontinued
services with our sales agent she's
great guys but you know i needed to
squeeze out more profits and wanted to
have more control have more of a dynamic
sales team you know making offers in
that so one of you really you know i
guess you know if there's a right way or
wrong way but what are you definitely
your thoughts and best practices around
internalizing your team and just kind of
keeping a lean mean like a high
functioning team that can coordinate
action and it doesn't get too fat where
your profits are bigger just i think
that would be some great advice because
i see some guys they hire this team and
then they hire this agency then they
hire this agency
neither of a sudden they're just they're
losing a lot of control and they've not
they're kind of like maybe delegated way
too early some of these things

51
00:50:00.000 --> 00:51:00.000
does that make sense
yeah i think there's
i hesitate to make a broad sweeping
generalization because sometimes an
agency is a good fit sometimes a sales
agency is a good fit um you sacrifice
sacrifice control for speed
um often times
um finding good vendors is you know just
as hard as finding good employees like
there's a lot of them and not a lot of
them are good so it just takes time and
effort i think most people i think the
biggest problem is that people are just
really impatient and so
yeah did you say people are really
patient impatient yeah because they're
impatient because they just want to hire
the you know they they interview five
people and just hire one and they're
like well i guess that's it it's like
well did this person blow you away well
they didn't blow you away then why are
we hiring them there's just a body and
then now you're gonna have to spend more
time getting them on board you have to
continue to spend your time getting them
to do stuff it's it's just it's just
like the first million is learning how
to promote
right you know one to ten is product

52
00:51:00.000 --> 00:52:00.000
10 to 100 is people
right and so
i mean that's that's really the game for
most people so if everyone is anybody
who's listening to this you just got to
promote like the rest of the stuff's not
even
even knows you exist yeah right i hear
you yeah once you cross a million buck
ish it's going to be the lifetime gross
profit per customer which is going to be
directly related to the quality of the
product
the monetization system behind it which
is going to be the series of offers
upsells price points etcetera right it's
gonna be the machine is is the second
part right and then after that once you
hit you know a million bucks a month
then it's all people
you know you do it anymore so you need
who's better than you not as good as or
something
i think you have to do more teaching
because you can't
i'm just being real you're
quarterbacking the people who need to be
taught are low quality is their raw
potential they're not realized right so
if someone's like smart and hard working
that's raw potential but they don't have
experience right and i can tell you that
very first you know hundred thousand
dollar employee

53
00:52:00.000 --> 00:53:00.000
it's different to hire your first 250
000 employee it's different when you
hire a first million dollar
different game
and so
i can tell you having done all of these
things um it's a different level of
acumen different level of delegation
that you can have different level of
freedom and what's ironic is that people
entrepreneurs want freedom and control
and you have to pick
you can't have absolute control
and then try and have freedom because if
you control it you are not free
so you have to use that and that's the
entrepreneurial journey is that you go
from having no control to complete
control and use your life giving away
control again
i love it oh man that's still great i'm
gonna ask everybody what their biggest
takeaway is
the stuff about offering the renewals
earlier on was was just brilliant for me
i want to thank you for that alex thank
you for sharing that so generously i'd
love to give you a chance tell everybody
um you know what you're going on you got
going on talk about acquisition.com i
know uh you're uh i think you're
recruiting uh how i'd love to let you

54
00:53:00.000 --> 00:54:00.000
tell everybody how to get the book where
to follow you on social media and
anything exciting you want to share with
the listeners
sweet well yeah the 99 cents i think the
hardback it's you see it's hardback it's
full color
um i make a total of one dollar after
you know
i think you had like 22 000 people
already pick it up i saw on social
recently yeah we're at 40 000 now it's
been
yeah so um
[Music]
so
people are telling people there's no
other thing
um it's amazing
anyways so uh one you can just search on
amazon you search my name or you search
the title you'll find it um youtube for
me is i just started a youtube channel
um it's got about 60 000 subscribers in
the first like seven months eight months
so it's people seem to be liking it um
so you can just search my name there and
then if you like the more
the shorter stuff you can go on the gram
um and see me there so uh that's that's
where that stuff is uh
with the fair go ahead well go ahead
sorry yeah what we're doing with

55
00:54:00.000 --> 00:55:00.000
acquisition.com
um i'm trying to take companies that are
doing like five to
you know
25 30 million um take them on invest in
them and then help them scale and so
right now um and there has nothing to do
with fitness it's just it's just
companies right now so we've got a
photography company we've got a
certification company we've got a
business coaching company we've got a um
we've got a
publishing company
um those guys actually published the
book uh so those are the four that we
have in there and then we obviously have
our three other companies which is the
software the supplements and then gym
launch and so we're just you know we're
bringing on about one a quarter um
it's just that's just kind of my long
game of
it's trip it's the transition it's
taking me about
year and a half two years to go from ceo
um to shareholder owner like that's the
that's a big hard transition so a lot of
people think that they are owners but
the reality is that you are ceo and
owner
um because if you if you have to make

56
00:55:00.000 --> 00:56:00.000
decisions and drive initiatives then you
are the ceo
like you own shares of apple you do not
do anything with it and so it's making
that transition um that is really hard
because a lot of times we we still just
because we're not involved in the market
like if you get your marketing team
outsourced you get your sales team
outsourced that's what i mean you have a
team that does it right and you've got
your product coach
whatever all of that
you're still making the decisions to
drive it
like unless you can show up and have an
empty calendar for months for those
businesses you charge so until you can
transition to owner right the reason
warren buffett is who he is is because
he never disrupted the the management
teams the businesses he bought you
bought them intact with the management
team and so just keep doing what you're
doing i think you're doing a great job i
think you're under price i bought you
right
that's it and that's what he was able to
have so much leverage and that's
ultimately i think the position that
most of us want to be in but
when you stop making decisions you give
up control
but you get freedom
and so just the question is you know are
you putting the and that's why i think
that you know getting from 10 million to

57
00:56:00.000 --> 00:57:00.000
100 million and beyond is it's just it's
all about
judging leading
people
dude that's freaking amazing what's your
vision for your youtube channel sorry i
just gotta ask
oh no i mean
stuff with acquisition.com everybody
is everything's so you know or 99 cents
whatever just like i can put it on it um
for the book it's on kindle um and by
the way the book is charged because i
can't control the price audible controls
the price on audiobooks um but uh
everything's free there's a course that
goes with it it's
acquisition.com you don't need to opt
for it you can just consume it loads and
checklists and all the stuff that go
along with this um book and it is
that's why i have nothing to sell
anybody anymore um so yeah i mean that's
that's kind of the i mean we own
businesses that generate profits which
is the point and so i don't need i don't
want to create another
yeah i
just want to do it so i'd rather i'd
rather help the companies that are at
that you know five ten million fifteen
million dollar mark
go uh to the next level it's one of our

58
00:57:00.000 --> 00:58:00.000
young guys on the rise uh let's just
speak to just last question i promise
just on investing i've never asked you i
didn't even think about asking you on
investing but since you touched on it
what's a good use of like you know how
you're utilizing your money you know
i've heard you know cardone kind of
summarizing you know invest in yourself
invest into your brand and invest in the
assets can you have a little a tier just
kind of like a simplified version of
your investing strategy i think that's a
pretty good i think that's validation um
i mean overall it's like you invest in
yourself
because you want to get skills you
invest in your brand because no matter
what you do your brand is still be there
and it'll jump start anything right and
then you have asset success um i think
the biggest
issue most people have is they start
trying to invest way too early like
i mean i didn't actually make my first
investment decision and so i think i had
14 million
after taxes in my bank account
like i didn't even i'd even make that
and some people were like that's crazy
that's ridiculous but it's at the same
time like
that's kind of something right you're

59
00:58:00.000 --> 00:59:00.000
investing all this money but they're
broken like what are you investing i'm
like look you the only people who will
to criticize that are poorer than you
right
i'm just telling you right now so
number one tip of advice don't listen to
people poorer than you second piece of
advice don't listen to people poor than
you want to be
oh man right like if someone's making
like um if you're an employee then it's
a totally different equation if you're
an employee and you know what you're
well your fixed income you know i mean
like what your what your income is going
to be more or less then i would still
invest in skill so i could get a better
job that pays more that's me right it's
like everyone's like well like if unless
you're like i'm a teacher i love being a
teacher and this is only wonderful in my
life cool if that's what you're doing
then you've already won because you love
what you're doing and then you're you
know you're putting a certain percentage
of your paycheck away if you're like i i
want to make more money then you should
be investing the skills that are going
to take you to the next level of your
job because trying to save on
60 000 a year when if you just invest in
yourself you can get to 250 000 you're

60
00:59:00.000 --> 01:00:00.000
in a better position like
like
12 months later then why would we waste
time trying to invest the excess 10
grand to get the s p return when you can
forex your income right it's just it
doesn't make sense right and i'll tell
you this last point because i get
passionate about this is that
like every super rich person you see and
people ask me for investing advice this
isn't a shaky i'm just saying in general
people ask me for investing advice
because now i have money to invest
i got money by making money not by
investing hmm
wow
and so i think and every single wealthy
super you see you know mr wonderful yeah
a 400 million dollar exit
it like
mark cuban billion dollar exit so people
see this and they're like oh you must be
a good investor it's like well he just
received
all this cash and then he had to
allocate it right and so then at that
point then yeah it's then the
fundamentals come in buy stuff for less
than it's worth sell for more than it is
right like i mean the stuff doesn't have
to be overly complex but most people do

61
01:00:00.000 --> 01:01:00.000
it way out of sequence i had an 18 year
old message me yesterday saying hey i
invested 2 000 i'm getting 100 a month
quote passively for my 2 000 what should
i do and i'm like you should take the
two grand and buy a course on how to
make more money
that's awesome because we're dealing
with no flow
yeah dealing with no flow
so increase the entrepreneur really if
you're an employee or an entrepreneur if
you're an entrepreneur then i think the
the threshold is even higher for an
employee it's a lower threshold and
because there's there's less variability
you can you can always park a certain
amount with entrepreneurs like i spent
every dollar i had on more education
more skills more beliefs more network
more whatever um material i couldn't
find places to put the excess money
all right
i love it
i'm not saying everyone has to that's
how i did
yeah
um guys also if you love hearing alex
chat he's got an incredible podcast it's
called the game uh he rips pretty much
every day now

62
01:01:00.000 --> 01:02:00.000
it's
three days a week i think three days a
week uh short episodes as you can see
this guy's got what i call very good
word economy he lands a big punch he
gives a really good bang for your bucks
you don't have to listen to two hours to
kind of get one sound bite you know
listen to 10 minutes and get 100 sound
bites to apply immediately actionable
advice that's what this guy's all about
alex
your time is so valuable like the
insights you drop like there's no fluff
there's zero zero
zero uh fluff it's just pure gold and
you can see that in the comments
thank you so much man you guys all go
out and buy alex's book it is like
by far the best
book on marketing uh some of our top
students one of our guys in our group uh
frank i give frankie a little shout out
he does over uh you know 40k on a bad
day and he's uh one of our top guys and
he said to me i just listened to alex
from mosey's book all day
i talked to tanner too he said oh i'm
going to make a few extra million off

63
01:02:00.000 --> 01:03:00.000
that book so guys these are like these
are
exceptional marketers who are already
doing incredible things and alex is here
sharing and uh giving you guys his uh i
know this i know he's got loads and
loads more this is the best stuff on
this subject matter that we're talking
about today
to help you guys grow and you also hear
a story i really appreciate you alex
sharing your story on your on your uh
podcast he really humanizes himself i
think that's really crucial to help
people break out of that survival and
scarcity mindset when they're first
starting and i was really inspired just
to hear those uh first few years of your
journey so thank you for sharing all
that how awesome it was to not make my
first million dollars for until you're
six
you know
yeah most people don't hear that and
they think that they're the only person
struggling out there right yeah i'm the
only person going through this right now
oh i'm the only person that's you know
having all this you know rejection
i'm like no that's pretty normal i'll
tell you this much too just in the

64
01:03:00.000 --> 01:04:00.000
fitness space it's it's it's by its
nature a very aesthetic
um you know
status driven space overall right
everyone's posting on instagram
literally right sure you know looking
cool
and um i'll just tell you the story to
maybe drive this point home but like
there's a guy that i know
uh who's reached out to me multiple
times for help he's almost lost
everything multiple times just the last
couple years uh internet space he's in
how to make money in internet space
and i saw a little really put up and it
was like how to be a millionaire before
30.
i texted him and i said are you a
millionaire
he's like well i mean i've done a
million dollars in sales and i was like
do you need me to define what
millionaire is
he was like well okay well no i'm not a
millionaire i was like then stop [ __ ]
pretending to be once so that you stop
feeling like a piece of [ __ ] all the
time because you text me about how you
feel like a fraud i'm like it's because
you are one
so stop
and so i think it's like it's so much
it's so much better and i'll just say
this from from experience it's so much

65
01:04:00.000 --> 01:05:00.000
easier to have influence once you've
done the thing
than to try and get influence to make
money
make money and then you'll have the
influence and then you won't feel like a
fraud because you can point back to
evidence most people have no evidence
so you have to rely on your own pump up
and stories and emotions which are
fleeting
and i think the only way to stay in the
game for a long period of time is to
have bedrock a foundation upon which to
build your own church right and so if
the business is your church then you
have to build on a strong foundation
like i love garyvee's thing he's like
the first video i made was i was 34.
he's like we'd already done 60 million
you know in annual revenue before i even
started talking about this stuff
right and so i would say there's a
common theme throughout like the the
little trajectory i'm going over but
it's all good nuts
well like
i had one gym
and that gym was very profitable i
didn't start selling how to make money
with your gym from my one gym

66
01:05:00.000 --> 01:06:00.000
i didn't start it after two gyms i
didn't start it after five gyms i didn't
start i did start after six shifts right
but even when i had six gyms i wasn't
sure if i was gonna be good enough yet
so i started doing turnarounds and i did
almost a year of turnarounds before i
got rid of my gyms
and then from there after doing the 33
turnarounds at that point for almost two
years was when i was like you know
i feel like maybe i'd be able to do this
now right and then when we did 30
million in our second year people were
like dude you're business coaching and
i'm like i think i'm just going to keep
doing this thing that i'm doing you know
like dude you should do this for cairo
you should do this for salons i was like
i think i'm just gonna keep doing what
i'm doing yeah and then for another two
years right
120 million in sales and i'm like okay
you know i'll write a 99 cent book and
just see how that goes yeah it's like
yeah after he wins a gold medal he
doesn't start coaching on how to create
gold medals he's he goes up to then he's
got he's already thinking about the next
olympics the next super bowl the next
championship yeah i get you no i mean
i'm not anywhere near where you know
that level but i totally appreciate you

67
01:06:00.000 --> 01:07:00.000
know wanting to respect the process of
seeing how far you can take it
the process i think that the longer you
wait
the higher the peak the pyramid is
like it's just like
knowledge the reason so much stuff
everyone sees on the internet
is so useless is because it's
regurgitated it's not first knowledge
people are teaching stuff they've never
done which means they're not good at
teaching it because they don't actually
understand it
which is why you should never feel fear
a competitor who copies you
very nature they won't be better than
you they require you to exist you do not
require them
people were like dude i saw your value
creation someone else so they didn't
give you credit i'm like i don't give a
[ __ ]
so send the team after them oh let's
let's press a lawsuit yeah exactly
exactly because they're they're um
trailing right they're if you're
innovating and they're always trail
they're always a couple steps behind
it's
never is
no one owns truth

68
01:07:00.000 --> 01:08:00.000
this is true right
and so anyways
the the reason people sound better than
other people is because they have depth
of knowledge
and you create depth of knowledge
through through through executing the
same patterns in different stimuli in
different environments so you see
different outcomes and so then you see
this huge pattern huge array and you're
able to have deeper inferences around
the things that actually matter right we
talked about the you know the early
early selling thing we talked about
earlier in terms of resigns right
yeah that comes because i've done it
yeah someone else had been on here and
had not done it they would have made
something up and it wouldn't have worked
yeah you're saying
tj bishop jakes
td bishop jake's pastor he says um
a lot of people use language to cover up
lifestyle
and it's this we live in the twitter
nation right and yet everybody kind of
skims the surface nobody can really
scuba dive with their subject matter and
i think you know that's why i'm never
going to write a parenting book alex
until my kids are about 45 years old

69
01:08:00.000 --> 01:09:00.000
then maybe they're out of the house
securely married then maybe i'll write a
parenting book but that's why yeah my
dad always says don't export things that
aren't working inside the homes like
vince don't go preach on social media
how your marriage is when you and flabby
are still fighting it's like get your
own ship in order right and i think
that's just what a great standard to
hold to
and to just say hey i'm going to get my
before i start preaching i got to have i
got to be living this out i love it
yeah
well all right bro i'll let you go man i
know dude you're the best man you're
like an angel everybody here
he's like an angel all right all right
brother well hey um everybody uh be sure
to share this on social media uh take a
screenshot
alex's instagram is for mozy and uh tag
him tag myself we'll both reshare it for
you guys and be sure to go grab if you
have not yet 100 million offers it's his
first book in a multi-part series
which was like the best news i've heard

70
01:09:00.000 --> 01:10:00.000
all day when i heard this is just the
first part did you say 10 parts yeah
oh geez okay well you better get started
guys
and uh we'll see you all super soon guys
ciao
