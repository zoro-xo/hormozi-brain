1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:00.000
right now the only
literally the only asset we own
besides like business equities and stuff
is uh
is this car
[Laughter]
we rent we rent that place
and uh
that's it we just well to be fair we
just got two homes in henderson yeah um
which is like yeah i know it's that way
that's where uh my buddy stan lives
yeah rhino yeah efforty yeah we chanced
to meet him yet i did i did we worked
out
um awesome
stan is big and strong
oh yeah he's still a monster
he's still lifting like a complete
lunatic
i'm always like what the [ __ ] is he even
bothering doing that for he already did
all that stuff you already won you
already won yeah yeah yeah go home eat a
[ __ ] sandwich
that's right
i like some of the diet stuff you've
been talking about too because people
love to they love to complicate that
stuff
i'd love to get into the mitochondria
yeah and make it just like

2
00:01:00.000 --> 00:02:00.000
this uh
ever evolving math equation that no one
can ever solve right
where where we um we try to have like
as much
chinese food and uh and
bread as we can you know that's kind of
dessert as possible
yeah it's funny man because you've been
i mean
i started training like
hard
when i was like 14. right you know
yeah and so i started like competing and
doing powerlifting meets when i was 19
20.
and so it's funny because like i know
that i'm i'm young you know what i mean
big picture wise but like wise it's like
i'm on like 19 years
right yeah it's funny because i feel
like most the guys that
are have been in shape for like
almost all their lives um
have simplified
most things to just like
calories and protein and lift heavy [ __ ]
occasionally right um which is more or
less what we've tried to do with our
yeah the hard part is some people have
gotten to be so unhealthy that they

3
00:02:00.000 --> 00:03:00.000
probably need to get healthy first in
order to
have the calorie equation benefit them a
little bit faster and a little bit
better
you mean for like losing weight yeah
just for losing weight like some people
are just they're their bodies are really
messed up
and they probably need to get used to
just eating natural foods for a little
bit to help them cut back on the overall
amount of food that they're eating yeah
you know and you get
getting healthier and losing weight can
kind of go together but some people are
a little stuck
sometimes after they lose some weight
you know sometimes they lose 30 pounds
and they're stuck for a while yeah i've
seen that happen with some friends where
it's like they are a little bit more
stuck than the average person
but the answer isn't necessarily just to
tell them to move more and eat less yeah
because they don't feel like moving more
because they don't have enough energy
because they're eating some of the food
that they're consuming and that's where
it gets to be like well maybe you should
pay attention to the actual food choices
a little bit more right because you're
not getting that much from like a

4
00:03:00.000 --> 00:04:00.000
pop-tart i was literally gonna use a
pop-tart i was like so like pop-tarts
first potatoes yeah yeah yeah it's nice
when you get ahead though when you get
ahead it's like that everything really
works really nicely and
it can be it can be more convenient same
with money right same with
that's a good way of putting it put it
getting ahead of it
i was thought it was funny because we
had this idea that came out when we were
talking to stan um that i feel like i
said like have passed it late and it was
like
uh he said something because i was like
i don't really train that much anymore
he's like me neither he's like he's like
our trainer like once a week maybe you
know and he's like it's crazy how little
i have to do to like look the way i do
right and um he said something like yeah
dude just enjoy the fruits of your labor
and for some reason there was like a
spark that went off i was like oh i have
a passive body right now it's like
active income and passive income but
just translating it to like it's like oh
i don't right this is not like you've
stored away enough active effort that
now you can maintain
you know this physique with like pretty
passive effort like i can still eat
twizzlers every day and you've heard
people before talk about like

5
00:04:00.000 --> 00:05:00.000
being a success before you
are successful like here's your
if you want to attract money you want to
attract women be an attractive person
and it's not necessarily like
the look it look can be a big part of it
obviously but
have attractive features you know if you
have a championship mindset if you've
got
if you're willing to work hard and you
don't give up on stuff easily you
are willing to be foolish and like mess
up and make mistakes
i think other people find that to be
a leadership like quality that they'll
be attracted to
and then money will probably follow
somewhere after that yeah it's
interesting when you look at it from a
time horizon perspective of
uh the doing this versus the like the
getting side right um so it's like you
are a success the moment you begin doing
the doing and then
the having or the getting happens over a
longer time horizon and so some people
will
stop doing the right thing because they
measured on the wrong timeline

6
00:05:00.000 --> 00:06:00.000
i always find that interesting from like
a business and or body perspective is
like yeah i was working out and i was
you know eating well
and then i stopped 12 weeks later well
you know
you're doing the right thing you're
measuring on the wrong time
i tried that diet it didn't work yeah
that's what they always say and then
you're like whoa
it's not working because you're not
doing the work any longer yeah
did it work okay when you were doing it
sounded like it was it sounded like it
was working for a little while while you
were actually implementing it
and then the
success discontinued when you stopped
okay
just make sure let me write that down
making sure i'm tracking well so what's
what's what's what takes up most of your
time now like what's your what's your
focus where's your energy going
doing a lot of podcast stuff all right
yeah i've been spending a lot of time um
i got two other co-hosts we've been
doing the we've been i've been doing a
podcast for the last maybe six or seven
years
and uh

7
00:06:00.000 --> 00:07:00.000
just i've kind of circled the wagon with
as many different fitness people as i
can
but the show isn't really we don't just
focus in on fitness people i just
like to talk to interesting people and
get around people that are
have different perspectives and
you know learn from people and we've
learned all kinds of stuff
learning how to walk learning how to run
that's cool learn how to do all kinds of
different things
um
and just
you know a lot of things kind of thrown
in the face of uh
a lot of traditional training that i
learned over the years
like what reinterprets reinterpretations
of strength
you know like what's you look great
you know i'll thank you but like what
you know what is you know what is strong
you know what is like for me it was
always just like a barbell like let's
grab a hold of a barbell
that's the way you know the football
coaches and strength coaches
you know our guys are you know
cleaning 365 and they're squatting five

8
00:07:00.000 --> 00:08:00.000
plates or whatever
those are the measures that we used but
are they even decent things that we're
measuring yeah totally does it have any
value at all to a football field
i think it's definitely debatable yeah
can it be helpful i think absolutely i'm
sure it could be
uh how effective or are there other
means you know to do do some other
things
i just find all that's really
interesting and uh you know when you
think about someone
again on their weight loss journey yeah
they're like oh i signed up for a 10k or
a 5k yeah i'm like oh that's really cool
you're interested in running they're
like no i hate running you're like
yeah then you're like well wait why are
you running and they're like i'm trying
to lose weight right and like oh well
that might not be the best thing to like
lose weight so i find that like
so many different things that we're
trying to work on or spend time on are
maybe not that effective of use of time

9
00:08:00.000 --> 00:09:00.000
in terms of what the actual goal is yeah
and then trying to learn more that for
myself and be able to teach that a
little bit more to people so they can
just be more efficient
maybe start out with a little bit better
decision
and lifting weights is a shitty thing to
sell people on but i've just
i've always felt like uh
i've always felt like everyone kind of
has to lift
yeah uh everyone is pretty broad
statement so there's people that might
would you say lift weight or just
resistance training in general
yeah some form of resistance yeah yeah i
was scared
yeah the gym the gym is like
the gym is in your heart you know i mean
like
the gym the gym is like for me when the
cove had happened it didn't matter a lot
because i was like i
i'm gonna do some [ __ ] push-ups or
something you know i'm just i mean
even i hated a lot of that stuff um
yeah i i stopped going to my gym a
little bit because uh
just no one else could go so i was like

10
00:09:00.000 --> 00:10:00.000
this kind of sucks yeah
and then at a certain point we just
opened back up anyway
how was that in california for you
oh you know it's you know it see it
seemed like there was like craziness
going on in california but there wasn't
really like
hey what i don't think was any different
than anywhere else i mean you'd go to
the grocery store and people had masks
on and
if you didn't have a mask on someone
would [ __ ] their pants basically but
that would be you know the extent of it
yeah it wasn't
so what kind of training do you uh
do you do now
i think this guy's a big power lifter
look at that guy waddling in that's joe
sullivan i know joe yeah
joe's a [ __ ] animal oh that's an lo
all right
yeah he's super strong
i do all kinds of stuff like uh today
like i'm down for kind of whatever but
uh
i don't know
i do like a lot of kind of full body
stuff i have i have workout adhd really

11
00:10:00.000 --> 00:11:00.000
bad
so i get excited and i'll pop over and
do like different things if i see
machines i haven't seen before and stuff
like that
i just like to have fun with it really
more so than anything but i've always
been that way even when i was
lifting the big old heavy weights what's
your ethnicity uh persian persian okay
yeah
now i was seeing videos of you i was
like he's something slightly different
than
he's something slightly different than
me but exactly what it is yeah i was
like i'll just ask him
yeah
they have good good strength genes and
oh yeah yeah they'd usually do really
well in weightlifting and wrestling so
there you go did you ever consider doing
an uh any bodybuilding
no
no
too much uh skimpy pants skimpy shorts i
just i just never um
i mean caleb knows this because i ask it
all the time it's like what problem are
we solving right when we like start
doing something it's kind of your point
about like 5k for the 10k
it's like you know why would i what
problem am i solving for me doing
bodybuilding you're just going to go

12
00:11:00.000 --> 00:12:00.000
down and go up
yeah and like i'm not trying to win and
i'm not trying to make it a career so
like right all it's going to do is to
track me from the other problem i'm
really solving which is like make more
money or whatever

hey the cabs are underrated right
it's starting to burn which i do
switch legs
how many sets three sets i do like five
or six
so i had like half training
i'm doing his workout someone's got to
do it i saw you waddling
out there i'm still still
i'm not i'm not ascended to the
cardiovascular you guys are [ __ ]
savages
the uh
the high rep squats with the 520.
so yeah i just want to come over and say
i will try it with 620 yeah exactly
eventually we were like let's just keep

16
00:15:00.000 --> 00:16:00.000
incrementally increasing this each
offseason and like work up to like 600.
so
i don't know it'll be fun what's the
record 600 for reps anybody know
[Music]
520 for some reps too like yeah yeah
crazy i think you guys uh sparked that
back up again you
know it's uh it's i've seen wedding do
it i saw uh
i saw a couple of bodybuilders in europe
doing it
but it's yeah you know just trend
setting
how it goes somebody does something
stupid enough and they're like oh that
was they're going to go from cabbage
we'll see if someone comes out of the
woodwork and do like 30.
larry wheels
one of those mutants be like okay i'll
try it how much was it 555 okay
like 34 some stupid [ __ ] like that well
cool but uh what are you in time for
dude
i'm with him for today you guys know

17
00:16:00.000 --> 00:17:00.000
alex yeah i met him a while ago don't
like know him well but just like hey jim
guy underscore the secret calf workout
that's supposed to make you burn body
fat so we don't share it publicly though
oh oh it's not okay
sorry it's crazy
say there's five sets of 20. like i'm
alright my calves already dying
i think you're
i can feel my
the foot
arch this is not good this isn't healthy
it's funny i watch stuff like that and
i'm like i shouldn't sleep
like do i like this like what do i i
mean i like it like what do i you know
that's me because i'm like do i
do i like it like it's kind of weird

18
00:17:00.000 --> 00:18:00.000
the best calf pump i've ever had in my
life
[Music]
even the lightest of weights is
challenging yeah right it's a hard it's
like
it's kind of a tough movement yeah
and then even just kicking your leg back
like this is hard it's weird yeah so
should be like
you know like
pull your hips in it's like i can barely
even do it like body weight sometimes
so this is what my goal is
i'm just curious look at that look at
this look at the thickness of his leg
look at this thing it's so much bigger
than one right so it's got so much more
girth
the hammies the hammies were really good
when i did a bodybuilding show and that
was just from years of powerlifting you
know all those squats and kind of
sitting back into the squat and not
using the quad quite as much yeah really
helped with the hamstring development
people like what'd you do for your
hammies i'm like it's been squatting a

19
00:18:00.000 --> 00:19:00.000
thousand pounds i don't know
it's all you gotta do just a g a k if
you will
a gram
yeah people ask me all the time they're
like man alex why are your hamstrings so
good i'm like well you know
they're not it's the tight shorts it's
the tight shorts i get smaller clothing
that's typically my
yeah
i go to
top in the children's section and
everything looks bigger
count any reps or you just kind of go
15-ish probably
count money or no
that i count are you a stat guy you look
at a lot of numbers
for your business
are you a spreadsheet guy
yeah
yep
100 percent
have you always been that way
yeah
i wouldn't say i'm a numbers guy it's
more like i just want to i want to

20
00:19:00.000 --> 00:20:00.000
understand it more than i'm like a math
guy i was actually not like that good at
math in school
um
and i think it was like i thought i was
bad at math you know like you make these
decisions about yourself like oh i'm bad
at math
and then i was like 25
and i i just like you know what if i
weren't bad at math because i used to
like not do things i'm like oh that's
not for me i'm not good at it you know
and so i uh stopped using a calculator
for like a year
and then tried to like start just you
know calculating the tip in my head and
right doing that stuff and then um
and then i started getting like okay at
math and so now people were like dude
you're so good at me like you know it
wasn't yeah i just well now it's also
just uh
as you get to be an adult there's just
like more more zeros tacked onto it it's
still the same thing like
simple math i think a good place to
start is like uh maybe just work on like
not getting ripped off and screwed over
you know
so that way you're not paying 700 for
something that's really 300 and

21
00:20:00.000 --> 00:21:00.000
just little little things like that or
having a
at least an estimation or a good guess
on how much something should cost right
yeah
what was your first business
so i'm actually writing the book right
now
and so my first business was
a charity project called the free print
free training project
so people would donate 500 to a thousand
dollars to the charity of their choice
and i would train them
and so it was like kind of a good will
and i got i got testimonials from it
and then that's what started my online
business that was for profit i used the
testimonials from the charity
to uh start the
for-profit side
i started doing that um i'd like
why why did you make this switch
i wanted to do fitness full-time and i
couldn't i wasn't making any money on
the charity so i
i was like hey i'm doing this for profit
now and i got like 20 guys who signed up
with me
and then um i like i like that you made
a change though because i think
you know a lot of people that they

22
00:21:00.000 --> 00:22:00.000
they try something and then they're like
oh this doesn't not working yeah but you
just made a small switch you're like i
still want to do this yeah but i'm going
to provide it in a slightly different
way
yes i switched to the for-profit and
then um
from there i i wanted to get in i went i
figured the next step was to start a gym
so i
i would do my online training clients on
the weekend and then i would do my
i went and drove out to a gym owner in
california i was in east east coast
and asked him if he could like
like mentor me and uh
he said sure and so i worked with him
for like three months and just like when
he went to the gym i went to the gym and
worked from like he did four to four so
you chop it four at the gym and then we
leave at four
so i did that and then um
i started my first gym in huntington
beach
and that was like my very cool
my first business experiences i don't
know how we're aware you are of my gym
but my gym is free is it really yeah i
didn't know it was free yeah oh this is

23
00:22:00.000 --> 00:23:00.000
so interesting yeah i started super
training in uh 2010
and uh
you know from the
from the jump it's something i wanted to
make i'm sorry 2006. yeah driver super
training in 2006.
slingshot started in 2010. yeah but i
wanted to provide the gym to be free
just because it's
powerlifting is a huge passion for me
it's what i love to do
and i just didn't want any uh any
strings attached i just wanted to show
people how to get stronger on top of
that i knew that
i needed to find like-minded people that
literally all they cared about was
getting stronger yeah because i was so
deeply invested in power lifting at the
time so i was like this gym is going to
pay me back more than i could ever
figure out how to get to monetize
directly a monetization from it the
other thing that i recognized was
i've been doing this stuff for so long
yeah i've run into so many people yeah
i've gone to so many seminars i've paid
x amount of dollars to do stuff and it's
like what are you going to pay me to

24
00:23:00.000 --> 00:24:00.000
train yeah 50 000 a session or like
you know what i mean even even a book is
a great example
you're going to write a book yeah it's
going to sell for 20 bucks or however
mindsets
for the same reason
right yeah i just want more people to be
able to make money yeah and i know grant
cardone's giving away free books and
stuff like that too right
a lot of people do stuff like that
because
you give me a hundred thousand dollars
for this book yeah that could make you
10 million dollars a year you know it's
like
it's hard for people to get that you
know in their brain so
yeah i always wanted to provide a gym
for free i love fitness and and uh just
trying to lower the barrier of entry
into any form of fitness whether it be
power lifting or how do people get
involved in nutrition i didn't know the
gym was free i like love that in so many
ways
because it's funny because i made this
tweet that went viral that's like
most people don't make money because
they're not willing to wait 12 months
so it's like
you started everything with like giving
first you're just like

25
00:24:00.000 --> 00:25:00.000
here i'll provide i'll give i'll give
and like
if you just delay the ask or don't even
make an ask like
it comes back so much bigger
but like that patience is the thing that
no one can take it's the same thing with
uh
fitness you know it's like
no one wants to give the time to get
back the body right it's so interesting
so i feel like
the big universal law of success is just
being able to wait
how many people come to the gym
there's like a few hundred people that
come through there in a given week
yeah that's crazy
and so there's no membership you just
walk in no membership fee uh you have to
sign a waiver yeah
and uh i don't allow people to wear
other other brands okay you only wear
slingshot brand okay because that's what
built the whole place it's the deal okay
that's great and then everybody takes
pictures and stuff it has slingshot on
it yeah exactly that's cool i didn't
know that and
and i even don't really care that much
about that it's just like a general like
house rule sometimes people will wear

26
00:25:00.000 --> 00:26:00.000
stuff i'll say they just don't film yeah
but it's just weird yeah you know it's
like this is the brand yeah
and then you're wearing a different
brand yeah
i think that's so cool
i like that i know caleb loves that yeah
caleb loves that yeah yeah
yeah
it's uh
again it's a hard thing to put money on
when i have
people that have overcome addiction and
people that have overcome
uh being bipolar people have they have
all these things that they've tackled i
call it lift through it people have
lifted through it yeah
and uh yeah like okay there's
definitely people that do monetize that
and they got every right to but for me
my interpretation of it was
let me have this be free so i can really
i still feel like i'm getting more out
of it than they are totally and i feel
like that's the best i feel so rewarding
feels so good to me
it's like i get more out of writing the
book than anybody who reads it right
right you know i learned more about the
topics i'm writing about than anyone
else does
so i feel like it's better every time
you write probably yeah hones in your

27
00:26:00.000 --> 00:27:00.000
skill sharpens a sword
it's kind of interesting i haven't
really done much like you know
honed in isolation work in a bit
so i'm already feeling these two these
two movements that we did yeah all right
right off the bat
i just want to have some muscle that's
the quad next what are we going to do i
would normally do some sort of like full
like one more like this would be my big
comp combo whatever
yeah i don't do many squats though let's
uh so i usually do one of the machines
so i don't know
people in here i got a bunch of stuff
hey how are you so good to see you so
good to see you competing pretty soon or
what yeah ten days ten days now so
getting shredded look at that
the hell's going on
what's up uh
i saw him i saw him yeah i saw them like
i saw them like waddling in like
i was like i know that walk yeah yeah
i'm just you know here today with alex
yeah

28
00:27:00.000 --> 00:28:00.000
just getting in a workout
staff
all right around
so i'll usually do
i think a girl's deadlift with like 550
or something or maybe even close to 600
it's good to know
i'm weaker yeah stay out of her way yeah
um whatever so like literally whatever
you're in the mood for i love these
what is that but i like the lake the the
squad
belt squat
oh belt swap yeah
let's uh let's mess with this for a
minute
all right
i'm not sure if i know how this one
works
yeah i mean you belts up and then
this uh
when you pull this up this goes down and
you slide it off
huh
i don't know if i've seen one like this
before
the reason i like this one though is
that the strength curve so like when
you're at the top it's the heaviest in

29
00:28:00.000 --> 00:29:00.000
the i think it's lighter at the bottom
oh interesting
wow
kind of has a built-in like slant board
to it yeah
using my microphone
[Music]
really
that's pretty awesome i like that i like
the feel of that how do your hips feel
after like all the squatting and dead
lifting and
my body's holding up pretty good i'm
like i've been doing a lot of running
and stuff lately yeah so
i can't believe you run

30
00:29:00.000 --> 00:30:00.000
i've i've never run yeah i run like four
or five miles almost every day that's
crazy yeah i would feel like your knees
would just like
my knees like blow out of my
because you're what 2 30
i'm yeah i'm right around 2 35 or so and
uh
yeah 45 years old it's crazy still
holding up
well you know it's funny because i was
talking to stan about this and stan just
like he's like yeah you know after all
the weight really had to rehab right i
was like oh how long did it take he was
like six weeks
he's like yeah now i'm good no pain i
was like
that's true i think we all kind of
understand like
we have some nice genetic gifts too yeah
like we like to kind of think that we
don't
to make it seem like we're cooler than
we are but oh no i know howard layla
works she's my wife
and if i if she had my jeans
she would be
a freak right like i mean she looks
great right but she looks fit but she

31
00:30:00.000 --> 00:31:00.000
would like if i train like she trained i
would look like i'm geared out of my
mind right
because like when i trained like her i
was like 245
and like
pretty late right
yeah stan is definitely
another planet a mutant yeah
he's a real mutant
mutant's the right word
good workout so far hitting up some legs
got some calves some hammies working the
quads right now so your calves look
great right now i know yeah it looks got
that calf pump
they don't mind me
oh sorry didn't mean to show that to
anyone excuse me
you know it's like a nip slip you have
like a cap slit
calf slip
there it is

32
00:31:00.000 --> 00:32:00.000
i don't know if you have
i like can't help myself but be like
there it is more like i can't even like
yes sir i can't even stop myself
there's no reason to yeah
well i've left it with some people who
are like really serious
they're like i want to be in the zone
and
and it's probably just from the days of
like training and owning the gym too
i'm always like there you go come on get
people motivated right yeah
because i
i also say what i want to hear you know
what i mean like right i like i'm
imagining i'm doing it like
i'll let someone be like easy
lightweight little extra push is great
keep it going you know like just
i love it up down squeeze
what do you think is some of the uh
setup of this gym like
something i notice right away it's very
bright in here which i
think is an advantage sometimes gyms are
kind of like i like the brightness dark
and expensive kind of
it's like energy you know i mean keep
the energy up the good setup was like
you can see everybody yeah
kind of no matter where you're at you're

33
00:32:00.000 --> 00:33:00.000
not like facing a wall
yeah
i mean it's funny because like there's
three gyms that i go to in vegas they
all have like different different things
that i like just like whatever and um
like
it's like if everything else will remove
like i feel like the vibe of the gym is
the thing that i come back the most for
even if they own the best equipment even
if they don't have the best that pie
comes from flex you think yeah
i think flex flex says hi to everybody
when he's here he's not better than
anybody you know he just really wants to
like you have like i'm sure it's super
training like a fostering environment
yeah like he wants people encouraging
yeah and trying to like downplay like
how scary my face looks
there you go yep
you guys see the face he's making right
there
kind of that mind muscle connection
you want to be able to feel these
feel every rip

34
00:33:00.000 --> 00:34:00.000
because you can haphazardly just go
through these but
you want to actually feel it get inside
the muscle
feel those muscles working and then you
don't have to always stack on more and
more plates
that was probably one of the biggest
things that changed from like
young me to older me
it's like i feel like i make my light
sets harder yeah you know learning to
flex yeah yeah
because then like joints started
becoming a part of an equation which
they never were oh yeah you don't want
that oh my god how do my knees how my
hips feel today
not this
right
[Music]
[Music]
easy
those quads
that's sweet
it's quad as a quad

35
00:34:00.000 --> 00:35:00.000
nice
so do you do barbell anymore
no not really uh
well i mean i'll do it occasionally but
it just takes it's
pretty time consuming yeah for sure
gotta warm up and
edge your plates yeah i like to
i like to get into the meat of the
workout as quick as i can yeah
do the damage and like
you're done move on other stuff
stimulate my gym is uh
in studio like everything's all one
thing
so uh
i might like warm up work out for 20
minutes
then podcast oh really then get done
with the podcast and like lift again a
little bit
then i'm usually out no way
how many podcasts a week you do
we do quite a bit we probably do like
five no way four or five that's wild

36
00:35:00.000 --> 00:36:00.000
yeah has has it been is that is this
your primary channel for is that for
like growth and slingshot it's doing
really really well our uh
our biggest channel is the super
training channel yeah that was like 600
000 subscribers on it screw it but that
one's really old too so it's like a
little deceiving it's not
it's important that you have something
that's hot yeah
because half of those subscribers they
probably died because they're so old
the old old power lifters yeah probably
long gone by now but they're not even
powerlifting anymore though yeah that's
right yeah they're probably legitimately
probably not um it is a season you know
i mean like not many people do it for
more than
five ten years you know yeah you're only
gonna do it for so long yeah
but the uh podcast channel um
has like 150 or two it's like 200 or
something like that
and that's moving along really nicely
and then downloads and stuff are all
really good
the biggest reason i'm putting such a
time investment in that
is because i already did put in a lot of

37
00:36:00.000 --> 00:37:00.000
time on the podcast end yeah and now
it's starting to really click and sync
and hit and
you know i got on tom segura's podcast
recently and there's like a couple other
bigger podcasts i'll be on as well that
tom's awesome when these things all
start to hit yeah they crescendo all
yeah
that's coming together maybe one more
set of this yeah for sure yeah we it's
funny because like
again the volume thing is like we had
for my podcast i've been podcasting i
think since 2017
and like no one even knew yeah right and
i was i've been pretty religious about
it like two
two issue a week for
however many years that is it's 2022 now
so five years
and um
it was only like
episode like 300 and something where
like the growth rate picked up
and so for like the first 300 episodes
it was like four years
like it was just like
two three thousand downloads an episode
like i just wouldn't it wouldn't get
above that
and now it's a lot higher

38
00:37:00.000 --> 00:38:00.000
yeah and caleb was like dude you're
number one
so if people like your short format
a lot of them are going to be hungry for
a longer format and more explanation
they're going to want to hear from you
more you know
there you go
what kind of kicks we got on today
looks like comfortable shoes there
look at them quads
we just got to shave them
shave them can them and he'll be ready
these are um
they're on amazon i bought like sorry oh
it's okay about like 40
pairs of different barefoot shoes right
and i just stuck with like the two that
i like the most yeah so i just wear
those when i work out and then i wear

39
00:38:00.000 --> 00:39:00.000
crocs when i don't work out
i dig it i really love the barefoot
stuff like
i don't know about you but like my feet
weren't fitting into regular shoes very
well
the only thing i don't like about them
is they smell
oh they're so like recycled or some [ __ ]
yeah so i am i wanted to find one that
was cheap so the ones that i have are
like 20 bucks right so i'm like okay
well if i
throw out one a month it sounds crazy
but it's 20 bucks a month yeah right so
it's like 200 a year for shoes isn't
that too bad
that's i think that's what people uh
love about you the most is the math that
you do on stuff you talk about like
eating eating out all the time and all
that kind of stuff
it is interesting though you spend a lot
of time
cleaning dishes and prepping food
but like while food's being prepped for
you you could be doing something else
yeah
it's like buying back time and it tastes
better than my stuff
so
i think also too if you have the money
why not eat
like what a cool thing to spend it on
i can't take it with me anyways

40
00:39:00.000 --> 00:40:00.000
i was i did this yeah i was on this
podcast and it's like
if you think of it if you take away all
things
that you buy with money that make you
more money
because what's the point of making more
money to make more money well that
doesn't make sense right so
the only thing you actually spend money
on is like
transportation
shelter
food
clothing
entertainment right so it's like and
personal services
so like getting your hair cut
you know getting a massage whatever
and so it's like
well how much does it cost you to hit
those six buckets
right everything after that like there's
no other
the only point is to make more money to
make more money
and do cardio for the sake of doing
cardio
this is me coming back from high
altitude
which means if
i had not been high altitude this would
be even worse
tell that he runs and i don't
we want to move on to next yeah

41
00:40:00.000 --> 00:41:00.000
um
shoot let's uh
okay so we did quads we did cry
sorry crying crying
well if you want what i what i do like
doing is after this i'll do quad
extensions okay let's do it and just
pump out like let's do it quick ones you
gotta like
i got that waddle going yeah knife
like it's like up in your shoulders too
for some reason
you got to kind of walk
and walk like this
get that momentum
all right
oh this thing's torturous
i got one of these
the prime minister's chamber
is great
all right
it reminds me of like an electric chair
yep
these used to be regular jeans everybody

42
00:41:00.000 --> 00:42:00.000
[ __ ] blew them out
there you go
as you train for a long time you can
start to
focus in on different muscles and
different areas of the leg
when you're newer it's a lot harder to
figure out
uh
is it
[Applause]
nice
bumpy
nice

43
00:42:00.000 --> 00:43:00.000
way
to launch myself out of here
be too stuck in there
thank you i appreciate it
to focus all the way up into the hip on
that
it's not just a quad
great set
yeah for me it's been small changes over
time you know and uh how old are you 33.
he's so cool like i mean

44
00:43:00.000 --> 00:44:00.000
as long as you're like even just three
quarters on target
you'll get a little bigger skin will get
a little thinner looking like
you'll just look more and more gnarly
like without
yeah there'll still be effort the muscle
maturity start like all those things
yeah you worked out with stan it's like
[ __ ]
there's striation popping out of
everything
his jaw his his uh
mandible
has striations he's got oh yeah yeah
he's insane he's the best
nice
easy
oh

45
00:44:00.000 --> 00:45:00.000
ouch
when are you headed out
tomorrow or morning or ah tonight oh you
are
see again we're working all the muscles
around here all the muscles around the
knee
but you can also start to get in up into
the hip
and you can actually
pay attention to each individual muscle
you might want to point your toes out or
have your toes depending on what you're
going for
and there's different ways to torture
yourself on this i mean
with this one in particular
we can keep changing the setting which
changes the strength curve
you could do drop sets
your partial range of motion as he was
doing there at the end like
just whatever you know do that with uh
dumbbell bench press or something
you're moving the weight moving the
weight and then all of a sudden
you're not it's moving you right yeah

46
00:45:00.000 --> 00:46:00.000
yeah
these ones always smoked me
were you talking about the top of the
hip like yeah here right i only took i
only started trying to go for that last
couple years yeah yeah i mean but it was
i was like i can't get i couldn't get it
to finish
and he was like let me see these two i
was like oh i was going you know like
yeah 90 rather than like and then do
that little yeah and you can kind of
angle yourself particular ways
this is all this to me i think all this
stuff is a skill set
this is a skill set to be able to learn
how to go deep on this stuff and
i like to talk about a lot of these sets
being like mindsets like really dig into
meditation and you don't need to totally
kill yourself you notice that we didn't
switch these up we didn't do the drop
set
you're just going to failure and it's
like
it's failure within the within the
context of we did three sets with not a
lot of rest in between the sets

47
00:46:00.000 --> 00:47:00.000
nice
nice
oh
nice
oh i'm gonna cry
nothing in there
like you can't get out quick enough
it's like
there's a moment where like
the only thing you wish is that you were
somebody else for a half second
like i just wish i was that random
person walking by it must be nice to
walk yeah
yeah because you like black out

48
00:47:00.000 --> 00:48:00.000
must be nice to drive yeah right
that's fine what do we got
so now now i go i'll go upper body
right my waddle is strong now
okay
so um backwards all the back steps over
there all right i like the plate loaded
um
hey guys i want to talk to you about
merrick health owned by derek for more
plates more dates now some of you guys
are on a fat loss journey some of you
guys are trying to gain muscle and some
of you guys are just trying to optimize
yourself and your hormones that's why
merrick health is so great because you
can get your blood work done a lot of us
don't know what's going on under the
hood as far as our cholesterol our
testosterone our hormones are concerned
and you need to get that checked
multiple times a year that's why we've
partnered with american we have
something called the power project panel
which has 28 different labs and if you
do get the power project panel they'll
actually be able to partner you up with
a patient care coordinator that will go
through your laps with you and advise
you on what you should do so andrew how
can they get it yeah you guys gotta head

49
00:48:00.000 --> 00:49:00.000
over to
merrickhealth.com power project that's
m-a-r-e-k
health dot com power project uh you guys
will see the power project panel and
when you guys check out use promo code
power project to save 101 off the entire
panel links to them down in the
description as well as the podcast show
notes
so
we they've got the extreme normal it's
our normal walk
yep coming through
good to see you joe
we're seeing you guys
all right i do this one normally because
all right you don't have to put as much
weight on it
how's this time sound good this weight
are you four you probably do 45 yeah i
usually like
you know
if i'm feeling crazy i'll do three
plates but usually two plates well
controlled is like a good
for me
there we go

50
00:49:00.000 --> 00:50:00.000
yes sir
there you go yep
it's a good warm-up
kind of hard to bend the knee at this
point yeah
i gotta pick my leg up
am i in here right there
i like because it gets lighter at the
bottom oh that feels good yeah yeah i
gotta get really good get like a squeeze
right
yeah it feels good he could stretch at
the top too i like that
[Applause]

51
00:50:00.000 --> 00:51:00.000
you make these look better
there it is
[Applause]
you're already getting out of there at
this point you throw 25 on
sounds good yeah
i see it this like
trap thing
when i would like go all the way so i
like end up going like and then i keep
my elbows it looks weird feel like a
little
little pain shooting through the trap
yeah
so
so rather than fix it i just decreased
my range of motion
it's going to work out great yeah i'm
sure if i do this forever it'll be
awesome well just over time you'll have

52
00:51:00.000 --> 00:52:00.000
less and less range of motion yeah
it'll be perfect
yep there you go
there you go
something has to do with the exercise
something has to do with some fatigue
that we've got going on but you notice
he's really like flaring the lats as
he's coming up
obviously there's a big big component of
it is like
being jacked so if you're newer
and you're trying like to visualize that
you might not see much but you can still
think about kind of flaring that scapula
out a little bit
and just trying to keep the weight in
your lats which is a really hard thing
to think about to try to think about a
lot of it just also can come from like
just a lot of pull-ups
like we do a lot of pull-ups i'm sure
you spend a lot of time doing pull-ups
for years not as much anymore right for
years the weighted chins was like the

53
00:52:00.000 --> 00:53:00.000
staple
which side hurts
okay
second set was better than first because
it got warm yeah right
yeah so you kind of need that
we got a lot of nice machines here yeah
nice
[Applause]
easy
nice
nice
get it

54
00:53:00.000 --> 00:54:00.000
i'm sure you've seen this with i don't
know different guys you've trained with
it's like they're working on their back
and they're doing a lot of back stuff
right and then you see them do back and
they're not training their back oh yeah
so it's like it's like yeah i keep doing
more volume keep doing more sets and
you're like well
it's hitting your rear delt and you're
trapping your electrics you know or
whatever rocking around so much yeah
so i feel like
learning that from other people was
helpful for me like older guys be like
it's i don't think you're using your
back man yeah i always say like one of
the better things i've ever seen in my
gym is people take weight off the bar
yeah people say hey you know what that's
not for me right now i need to actually
go a little lighter yeah i mean how
gratefully would you be
someone telling you that in business say
hey
let me do that sorry i'm in over my i'm
in over my head right here yeah you'd be
like oh my god no no problem
i'll help you out of that that's easy oh
you're spending a little too much over
here yeah that's simple we can cut back
on that i've never got no one really
they don't i've never heard that one
that that
right
it's like i've been in the business size
bodybuilding overlap a lot

55
00:54:00.000 --> 00:55:00.000
i've never heard anyone use that analogy
i like that a lot
cause it's true
surprise it's like it's not even the
wrong exercise you just got too much
weight in the bar yeah you're not even
doing the wrong strategy you just got
too much weight on the board so you're
intense great yeah
you're trying to bash anything you're
doing you're intense good elon matt you
know elon musk can take on paypal other
guys probably thought about building
digital banks right it's just [ __ ]
hard that's it all right that's a
thousand that's a thousand pound squat
you work up to it
there you go nice
good control
looking good yep
some really weird stuff going on with
the shoulder
there's some decompression of the
shoulder
shoulder goes up the lats stretch
[Applause]
the shoulder is actually going from
right here
all the way up like this

56
00:55:00.000 --> 00:56:00.000
you can't really tell because his arms
are going this way but the shoulders are
going this way like this and then he's
got to do the reverse of that
so he's not just pulling down and
staying like this
he's staying connected that's why the
arms are kind of slightly bent he
mentioned he's got a little
little twitch in there somewhere but
like he's like this and then he's
pulling down
the shoulders come down
and that's how your lats actually get
big is from the stabilization of the
shoulder
shoving the
shoving your shoulders away from your
ears
that's why the best deadlifters have
they got a lot of distance between their
shoulders and their ears
arnold deadlifted 727
and i don't even think he cared that
much about like heavy deadlifting
but look at the pictures
look at when he's going like this and
stuff that shoulder
is pretty far away it's kind of got a
slope
then he made up for it by being
really wide right
i think there could be variations too
like
you're gonna notice when i do this i
might cheat a little bit more in my

57
00:56:00.000 --> 00:57:00.000
power within crew i tore my bicep a
bunch of times so when it comes to back
movements i might have to get a little
more english in it or sometimes i got to
just lighten the load
because i can't can sometimes no longer
do the exercise the right way
[Music]
nice
nice ah
there it is
that is a really cool right back piece
right there yeah it's really nice
because it takes a little weight you
know i mean like you could put
you know like if i go and get to your

58
00:57:00.000 --> 00:58:00.000
top set quick yeah go on the single arm
uh the chest supported it's like you
know it takes
got to put five plates on every side you
know it's just a different lever
you want to do one more here or do you
want to call us
uh let's do one
with maybe lighter weight okay hit up a
little bit more reps
all right joe
we get it
you're stronger than us
dude stop showing off i think you just
did um hold on let me pull up an old
video
let me tell you what i used to bench
yeah yeah yeah it was cool i swear hold
on load up on this yeah so many guys
used to ask me yeah
i go to you know
guys to just like match their
girlfriends to get to me oh yeah yeah
i'd be like bro
you do you're like five you're like five
ten so it's a tense
you're like that was a beautiful girl
you just shoved out of the way
look at that guy's chest
you know what i love that at the trade
shows
people would wait in line and they'd be

59
00:58:00.000 --> 00:59:00.000
all excited they finally get
up to me and they're like man i waited
two hours
like i drove from kentucky and we're in
like columbus ohio or something like
that you drove a couple hours yeah
and like i've been dying to ask you this
question i always think it's gonna be
like a life thing yeah and like i could
just not lock out my deadlifts for the
life of me
right here i got a sticking point yeah
and i'm always like
i'm like
you know i think it's going to be like
they want something to be like life all
through it or something you know
should i do this with my career you're
like all right that's a good that's a
word yeah right i have 30 seconds to
collect the information recognize who
you are what your skills are yeah make a
life altering recommendation
let's do it
let's go if you're down i'm down
my grip slips at the top of my deadlift
i can't quite lock out my bench like
that's the greatest thing that you have
yeah
i'm guessing i mean for you i i probably
have a more simpletons response probably
more complex you know oh when it comes

60
00:59:00.000 --> 01:00:00.000
to like something like that locking down
a deadlift i'd be like do more of that
that's always much yeah yeah yeah uh
it's like do a lot of sets here
yeah just spend more time there yeah
just volume sorry i've been i've been
purposely dawdling to
give myself a longer respirator i love
it
some monsters in here
makes it motivating
there you go
this just like
my like inner lat
everything's like this

61
01:00:00.000 --> 01:01:00.000
oh when you first started lifting what
was it like uh you start trying to lift
heavy
lifting for a sport and someone steal
your bike
i had what happened bro i had a teacher
big black guy
mr givens
i was walking the hallway and he was
like he's like boy you left
and i was like no
he's like
you should
he's like you got the jeans
and i was like i don't know got a little
swole back then even yeah it looks like
he was like i was like i don't know how
he was like
stay after school i'll show you
and so he worked out every day for like
nine months
and so he and i would train together
two hours every day he probably got
jacked too i bet very quickly right
nice
yeah the arms especially
yeah
monster
very cool yeah i already been training
for like a year and a year and change
so it's funny though because he didn't
have like the real names for exercises
so we used to do uh i don't knows oh and

62
01:01:00.000 --> 01:02:00.000
it's like yeah yeah i don't know and
then he had three huggers yeah and so he
just told me and uh
we did uh sit ups and he had like crazy
abs and i really wanted abs
and so uh it's a good way to teach
somebody that like i don't like how do
you do it and so he would he'd be like
what's the capital of zimbabwe
and you just asked and i just was
sitting there you know i'm like 15 years
right right and then um
we did uh he called him givens ups
so it was like a mechanical drop set for
abs still to this day the more sore i've
been on kills yeah yeah so you would um
you know the the abs thing
you can hold behind your head so what we
do is
it's fir when you first start with him
he starts you flat
and then every like four weeks you bump
at one degree oh man and so what we do
is we do um
10
to 20
straight
[Applause]

63
01:02:00.000 --> 01:03:00.000
your knees to your chest and so you do
like 10 10 10 at that incline and we do
like three sets
and dude like
i couldn't like laugh yeah i could
really breathe
not that that you know i obviously had
the low end of body fat it worked but
you uh look ahead you lift this way
three times a week twice a week right
now twice a week but when i'm like
training training it'll be like five
minutes yeah i just do this i do the
same exercises
so i'll do lats tomorrow same and and
you don't care like if someone's in the
way you just go do something else yeah
yeah so you might miss a movement
because like just time or when somebody
was here i would have been like let's
just do those i'll go over here yeah i'm
not what's the difference yeah i'm not a
nazi about it
okay so they're on that so that would
have been what i would have done yeah so
um all right you good with uh some bicep
tricep or something yeah we could do
that i would say we could do um
yeah i'll ask how many sets i got yeah
what do you what
i'll say what i do but
i'll usually just grab
one of these guys

64
01:03:00.000 --> 01:04:00.000
and i'll do five to seven
and i'll just go straight down
uh yeah i just throw the rack i do that
a lot let's do it okay dealing with
curls yeah
yeah nothing crazy
just see how this feels my arms are
already pumped there's a great part
where the other 50 is
so maybe we'll start here we'll do two
two
there you go
i'll do that we'll just yep

65
01:04:00.000 --> 01:05:00.000
oh
yeah for anyone who's watching i um
i got this from kai greene but he does
the uh he does mechanical drop sets on
these yeah so he'll go like
uh
two arms and then start doing one arm at
a time
and then he'll go
from one arm like this to one arm uh
hammer right right so it's like you just
extend the [ __ ] out of the side
really until your arms can't move no
more
no but those like if i'm alone yeah i
like doing this
there you go requires a lot of your
shoulder too
when you're turning them over like this
you see all the muscles in the shoulders
and some people think that some of that
stuff's bad they think you rock a little
bit or
i think it's good
you don't always need to iso stuff
if we want we can get more isolation
work when we're done with these sets go
a little lighter on something else

66
01:05:00.000 --> 01:06:00.000
it's funny my my good buddy dr cashy
he's like man when people say hey he's
using more than one muscle he's like i
look at them and i'm saying so you're
telling i'm training more than one
muscle at the same time
tell me why it's a bad thing right he's
like all-american strong man and
you know he's
high seven pooler
and he's got a phd in biochemistry
you know what's going on yeah
he had a
375 log press oh [ __ ] at sub 230 as a
lightweight that's nasty yeah
he's
his ear his ear to shoulder his
shoulders like below his nipple oh [ __ ]
he like he's like is standing when he
grabs the barbells
before you're dead left right yeah
so i'm gonna go down a fourth yeah
it's a good way to use up some energy
right here this is how
alex earns his ice cream every day

67
01:06:00.000 --> 01:07:00.000
[Music]
probably still able to get in the bikini
that's all i wear right around the
camera
well it's just you know
honestly if i'm not sharing it
easy
nice
it's funny you're saying because uh
with cardio i like even when i got like
peeled lean i never did never really did
steady state right it was always just
like
short and rest intervals
do more work you know train more
a lot of times people don't need it yeah
sometimes people do there's some people
that like have a little
harder time controlling their food oh
yeah and there's people that just coming
from a place of being bigger yeah
dealing with someone that's
really struggled with their food

68
01:07:00.000 --> 01:08:00.000
it's a good idea to have the cardio in
there just to yeah
you know they're not going to follow the
diet all the way
it's like what problem are they solving
right it's like are they training
because they're trying to compete or
they just like right don't want to look
the way they look you know
that's the other thing yeah you got to
view cardio it's a
it's a tool and how long you use it for
and then whether you talk about
doing cardio taking steroids
looking at a supplement
going on a diet you always end up in the
same spot of and then what are you gonna
do
so and then what yeah you're gonna take
that thing and then what like you're
gonna take it forever you've seen
testosterone any of it it's funny
because when you do something for a long
time
you're like
well if i can't do it for good
it's like what's the point of doing it
for now
like unless there's a re like unless i'm
competing for something that makes a
difference in my life you're gonna uh
get particular uh pictures done for your
book or your business yeah whatever yeah

69
01:08:00.000 --> 01:09:00.000
so you're getting a little more jacked
summer's coming out yeah okay you want
to feel better yeah all right i'll chop
back some carbohydrate or whatever your
method is right
yeah i've always had to be really strict
about dessert i always have to get it in
a lot of times i don't want to eat it
but
you know i'm a big believer in doing the
boring work you know clocking in when
people don't want a pocket right you
know get that extra scoop
you know put the sprinkles on when you
don't want to
add the fudge even though
you know you could just use one another
chicken breast
do you um
do you limit
if you have dessert like you have like a
little bit of a
i eat if i'm hungry or any more if i
i'm less hungry less yeah really
honestly
kim sees me take down a whole
whole big old slice of cheesecake and
sometimes it's like three bites right
just depends on hunger or not
which is like not a
sexy answer but
it happens to be true you don't really
have a lot of like

70
01:09:00.000 --> 01:10:00.000
do you have snacks at your hotel or not
really oh really
not really much of us you have a lot of
good other habits
laced in there
and if you have dessert it would
probably be unlikely that you have three
of them in a row
there you go
yeah
well it's like i would rather eat
ice cream
than like nuts and rice right you know
and like i don't have a big appetite
naturally it's fair to say that you're
not like a food addict oh
i forget to eat
so i try and get my because i'm if i
don't think about food i lose weight
so it's like usually i guess the other
day i'm like [ __ ] i need a thousand
calories i'm like all right well
what do you got some dessert i'd say
this to anybody that's listening to this
either one of you guys anyone's
listening this
if whatever diet it is that you're
following
if you end up binging then it didn't
work yeah so if you're listening to

71
01:10:00.000 --> 01:11:00.000
something he says where he says i
i have some desserts here and there
if you're the person that's going to
binge off of that dessert
that he's talking about that's not what
he's talking about he's not talking
about an all-night binge
staying up until 2 a.m
because you don't want those calories or
whatever to roll over to the next day i
know these things
i did all that stuff if you follow some
of the things that i suggest
intermittent fasting a lower carb
lifestyle if you end up binging it
doesn't work
and a lot of times
it might not be that same day a lot of
times things creep in about three days
later
it's three or four days later when that
stress settles in that you end up
finding yourself bending so if you keep
binging and you're not dropping weight
you got to be honest with yourself and
say this is not working you might need a
tiny bit softer of an approach rather
than a more intense one yeah
i agree
i just like if you can't do it for a
decade don't do it for a day it's just
been like i love it same thing with
partners same thing with business same
thing with working out

72
01:11:00.000 --> 01:12:00.000
like i mean that's not to say there
aren't seasons right like if
you know targeted periods of time where
you do stuff that's excessive or not
normal but like
the 80 20 the 80 of the time it's just
it should be something you can do
without pouring too much yeah and joe
didn't drop
didn't drop a deadlift while we were
talking so that was the goal so loud
does he need that really drop it i mean
how heavy could it be well i mean he
probably put money to decrease the
weight if you can't control it you gotta
go lighter
should be a four second descent we
should talk to them about that
turn the nose out the mouth yeah
there you go
[Music]
alex for moji's secret arm routine
that has not yet been released
he was gonna put it in his new book but
he decided it's too secretive and we got
a small glimpse of it here today

73
01:12:00.000 --> 01:13:00.000
you know the biggest problem with like
the youtube follow my workout stuff is
that
you get snapshots rather than
oh yeah seasons you know what i mean
it's like
like we could do arms for five hours
it's not gonna make our arms bigger you
know it's like the fact that we did arms
first
every day for six months
even if we did five sets right we did it
every day for six months right right
it's kind of
that's like a business parallel it's
like you make a thousand phone calls in
two days and then
you don't call anybody for six months
it's like
your business isn't going to grow but
you make 30 a day
every day for six months
it'll probably grow and then they still
always come down to volume it's just you
can always do more volume over time
you know it's like if you work out 365
workouts at five sets
so you got 1500 sets in
versus like i did 20 sets of arms two
days a week for a month
it's like that's 160. you know 10 times

74
01:13:00.000 --> 01:14:00.000
the total volume doesn't matter
[Music]
okay we're killing these too like these
are like
yeah it's not until we're like going
completely blind and falling on the
ground but it's getting close yeah
uh your shoulders yep oh over here right
this cats
we've got some people complaining you
guys are dropping the weights over here
oh yeah yeah if you could put them down
slower are you more noisy yeah that's
what i okay yeah all right i was like
alex alex the guy in gene shorts at the
gym and then i was like somebody was
like oh he's a business coach and i'm
like wait oh [ __ ] okay so i got it now
[ __ ] took me a minute to connect the
dots but
you guys are maniacs these guys they
came to my gym yeah
and they just they
they always [ __ ] bring it training
their faces off
i mean i like to work out hard but not
like this we're still we're still in the
thick of it you know yeah you did this
[ __ ] like 15 20 years ago like we still
got still in the middle yeah so
you're in the [ __ ] yourselves up but not

75
01:14:00.000 --> 01:15:00.000
too bad you know what i mean
i have the world record in the squat so
that's why i'm [ __ ] so dense like i
get [ __ ] on a bodybuilding scene but i'm
really great under the squat bar so how
did you
i'm going to have him take me through a
bodybuilding trip
probably not for like a year and a half
two years now yeah
yeah his bench is coming back yeah 496.
so
is this your video or how
it's both okay yeah yeah i i went on the
product i was podcast a while ago and
like i got herniated 208 discs in 2018
from the pocket from uh from the top on
yeah
yeah
compress the nerve so my bench dropped
from like 570 to like 225. i've been
working back up i worked with jake yeah
and we're actually back at 496 as of two
weeks
[ __ ] awesome all right how'd you do
that uh i i think collected somebody did
like a squat off or something yeah i did
525 for 20. i needed 525 for 18. so

76
01:15:00.000 --> 01:16:00.000
yeah that's crazy that's awesome
not quite most classes 27 23 23 oh my
god
like that's what we were saying at the
beginning of you guys workout we'll just
run it back and do it next year yeah
exactly
did you train for it yeah okay
you guys both have online businesses
right yeah yeah
that's why i was like i felt like an
idiot because i like your [ __ ] i
followed your [ __ ] and i i [ __ ] knew
about you back when we were doing this
like super compensation [ __ ] oh yeah
like eating the [ __ ] yeah craig
knuckles yeah yeah that [ __ ] yeah you
know and i [ __ ]
because i've been around for a while and
i've known of yet and then i'm like oh
wait there wasn't like a 500 carbs a day
or something
greg lived with me and he was like same
thing as mr it was like you got the
jeans dude he's like we can do some
crazy [ __ ]
yeah and i was like because so i lifted
every 45 minutes kind of like you were
saying so i opened my gyms i was just
like i do three three exercises no no
rest barbell and then i go like work for
45 minutes and i set an alarm and i just

77
01:16:00.000 --> 01:17:00.000
immediately go cold set at set and i did
10 cents a day
watch yeah all right well yeah [ __ ]
embarrass myself now go for it we'll
stay out of your way
come on let's go there

78
01:17:00.000 --> 01:18:00.000
notice his ear to shoulder length this
is a key part of making a point earlier
yeah yeah great job no you look great
dude you look like a [ __ ] brick
that was solid
it looks like you uh almost like outran
it a bit you had to catch it
so that's that new kabuki the kabuki bar
it's like extra whippy so at the top it
bends more and you got to like touch how
hard you lock out right
do you like it uh yeah it's you got to
get used to it but yeah it's one of
those things like that's why we've been
training on it because we got a
competition in 10 weeks
let's go jake
nice good
nice
and jake's a really natural dead lifter
like i'm strength to squat this is
deadlift so that's great yeah
like this chip a little bit
he's great
yeah yeah a little bit better at poland
than i am
or something or just a

79
01:18:00.000 --> 01:19:00.000
so my thought is to wrap it up we can we
hit this and then i'll do the tricep
thing with you to finish it off because
we'll be perfect we'll be um
this is uh this is part of like these
these things that you see everywhere
uh-huh this is part of a space that i
created and then i wasn't able to patent
it yeah because it's just about the
[ __ ] circle you know what i mean
but before that they were that didn't
exist yeah i put that out there along
with the slingshot the slingshot's how i
was able to make the gym free is that
the primary um business slingshot yeah i
got slingshot and then i
i created products around the slingshot
to uh
again lower the barrier of entry into
working out like powerlifting hurts yeah
it hurts your elbows it hurts your wrist
it hurts everything so
i wanted to be able to protect people
your ego
i wanted to help people uh
head to toe so we make knee wraps and
knee sleeves elbow sleeves

80
01:19:00.000 --> 01:20:00.000
uh
belts the whole nine yards mummify
yourself in your toe
in whatever
it lifts itself at that point i brought
you a slingshot too did you really oh
thanks yeah yeah in our gym you know we
listened to like a lot of gangster wrap
yeah and so like i was just creating
wraps because i was like if you're gonna
wear a slingshot you're gonna be able to
bench more weight so it's like it makes
sense to use wraps and i was trying to
think of a name for him like listening
gangster rapping here all the time i'll
name it gangster rap and everyone's like
that's so stupid
and that's how i knew it was a good idea
like you guys think it's dumb i'm gonna
run with it you just wait someone's
gonna buy this right exactly so this guy
right here this is one this is one of
the slingshots and we make a bunch of
different kinds this one's actually
called the money shot
color of money color of money that's why
it's called the money shot right so i
got it
pop her open here
go ahead and throw that guy on oh let's
see let's go put your arms in there
whoops sorry about that

81
01:20:00.000 --> 01:21:00.000
nice and pumped now oh yeah yeah yeah
now you can't even move
there you go right about there is good
that'll work
arms are pretty dense let's go ahead and
try a couple push-ups with it oh
push-ups
it's for bench press push-ups and dips
oh that feels nice
it's like a trampoline
yep and you gotta see it's pulling his
elbows in a little bit so it's keeping
the elbows in tight you don't want your
elbow to travel too far past the midline
of your body just because it puts your
shoulder a little bit more oh it feels
good
it helps with your forearm your
technique allows you lift a little bit
more like naturally get you in a better
a better groove that's good thank you
let me just throw it down notice double
xl is what he thought was appropriate
yeah let the record show i was like that
guy's jacked
so how weird is this uh
kind of newer company that you have like
is that acquisitions like you're just so

82
01:21:00.000 --> 01:22:00.000
but like i get what i'm saying about
like weird is just like
you've had to like work so hard for some
of your opportunities yeah and then now
people are like hey like invest my
business you want to buy this or you
want to invest in this yeah
it's definitely different you know what
i mean it's funny though because i feel
like
if i if i track my career backwards it
was like
i got in shape people started asking me
how to get in shape and i was like
what's what i did you know maybe work
for you and then people start getting in
shape and start having a little business
around getting people in shape and the
people who got people in shape were like
dude how did you grow you're getting
people in shape business and i was like
what's what i did this will work for me
right and then so those people were like
okay that's cool and then i grew a
business about helping people who help
people get in shape
and then from there
other people who help people do a
certain thing like i help hairstylists i
help plumbers i help e-commerce people i
help whatever we're like dude how did
you build that business where you like
had some sort of like licensing
franchising type thing i was like well
this is what i did i don't know if it
would work for you this would work for
me they should do that you know it's

83
01:22:00.000 --> 01:23:00.000
like looking at the neighbor that's
always had something new yeah like hey
how'd you do that then they get
something else and you're like how did
you do that yeah and so i always feel
like um
most of the things have happened like
organically where it's like if you do a
good job at the thing enough people feel
like
hey how did you do that like that's what
i did you know and so that's that's what
we've done cool that's what worked for
me i don't know
yeah that's great
such a convenient machine i love this
thing oh dude i'm a big viking press fan
like huge viking bryce fan they just
feel good for me
i don't know why
i like it's unilateral too that's pretty
nice yeah
you can see the imbalances if you've got
i don't think i've ever used one like

84
01:23:00.000 --> 01:24:00.000
that before
because a lot of vikings
are bilateral yeah
two plates
sure
[ __ ] joe
making such a choice
good dude man joe if you're watching
this we get it yeah
we saw it heavy we were there
what do you think about like uh planet
fitness marketing like the lunk alarm
and stuff i mean i hate it from uh being
the target market that they don't want
to be there so that makes sense right
i'm supposed to not like it
from a basically helps generate money
though huh from a business model
perspective it's brilliant so they they
looked at it and they're like okay
92 percent of people
don't actually want to use anything in
the gym

85
01:24:00.000 --> 01:25:00.000
they want to sign out for a gym and not
come they're like you know
we could have smaller gyms that have
more members talk about about the people
that are here exactly no i mean like
legit they're like okay the people who
use the gym the most who we lose money
on a per usage basis are people who
actually use the gym they steal the
protein shakes on their way so they
think what do the people who use the gym
use they use heavy weights they use
squat racks they use chalk and so
they're like well if we eliminate these
three things that knocks out 80 percent
of the people who are actually going to
use the gym and so then we can have a
facility
sign up as many people as possible and
knowing they're never going to come and
then we'll incentivize them with pizza
legit and they're like hey
i'm on your side now yeah
it's ten bucks a month to come here
right and if you just come and get pizza
once a month you already covered your
ten bucks you're like what's the deal
i'll just come and get pizza and of
course they don't come to the gym to get
pizza either but they just pay their ten
dollars
the average planet fitness does has ten
thousand members
at 100 bucks that's all right
10 bucks a month so for them to make

86
01:25:00.000 --> 01:26:00.000
their model work is 10 000 active
members wow and um what they figured out
was
that you got to go easy on the exit so
someone's having a hard time whatever it
is
most people you know most gyms like send
you to collections they enforce the
contract plan of fitness took the
opposite approach because they need so
many members they need positive word of
mouth so if people were like no don't
sign up there it was [ __ ] pain in the
ass when i tried to cancel they sent me
collections they're like oh i'm not
there they're like oh no they're cool so
you go there and you're like hey i don't
want to pay anymore you can cancel the
phone they're like no sweat we can't see
you right now come back when you feel
good again and so people don't feel
afraid to come back in and so they can
go into a city that's got like 30 000
people and they'll churn through the
same
10 000 active and ongoing that's what
they do they just people get motivated
and sign back up and then they get
demotivated they just turn right through
them and that's how they took care like
i bet you if you ask people on the spot
hey like i noticed you haven't been
coming that much for me to cancel your
membership they'd be like no no that's
okay you give up don't do that yeah for
ten bucks a month it's like i pay 10
bucks a month for the idea that i might
someday go to the gym right i know i'm
gonna come in starting next year yeah

87
01:26:00.000 --> 01:27:00.000
it's a different model
nice
[Music]
[Applause]
you for giggles
yeah
for g's nesses
so i was always uh a good presser
um i have short arms you know what i
mean it's like felt comfortable on the
pressing movements yeah i've like
i don't i like i know i basically never
benched even like my whole career really
benched and like i did that one thing
with greg and i got i got like 400 like
six weeks just training bench every day
and i was like i don't i don't this
isn't mine
but like i'm a horrible deadlifter right
i can like bench eighty percent of my
dad

88
01:27:00.000 --> 01:28:00.000
there you go nice
good set
you know what's uh i think really
important about the deadlift
nothing
nothing there's not a single exercise
that's like overly you know like of
course a deadlift is gonna be a nice
movement yeah
you know i would just say like you
probably have trained like you've been
training for a long time you've probably
done seated rows and bent over rows and
probably pictured off the ground and
it's like yeah
do you have back pain no
like you know lily bridge eric lilly
bridge yeah yeah we're listening to some
some whatever something he was doing
and uh they're like so how much do you
uh how much do you wrote and he was like
i wanna do rose they're like all right
we'll do a lot of pull-ups he was like
no never done them yeah they're like

89
01:28:00.000 --> 01:29:00.000
well what do you do besides deadlift
he's like that pull-downs and the guys i
remember interviewing were like
you got to be kidding me like that's
your primary accessory and i was like
yeah
works for me
dad lifts
so it's a good filler for him right yeah
i just thought that was like
and i think somebody commented on that
thing and was like for every person who
says this is the exercise you have to do
he's like i'll find you somebody who's
strong as [ __ ] he's never done the
exercise well if you're doing movements
that are helping you to stabilize your
body and stabilize your spine yeah you
did all that ab work when you were young
and i'm sure there's movements where
you're like there's a hip hinge involved
but even if you didn't do
a specific weighted hip hinge movement
yeah i don't see anything to where i'd
be like oh his back's real fragile he's
gonna blow something out
you know what i mean yeah
there you go
nice
[Applause]

90
01:29:00.000 --> 01:30:00.000
nice
there it is
i feel like as i i don't know if you're
the same way but for me
i try and like for me it's like if i do
more volume with something i'll get
stronger at it and so it's been more
like what exercises can i do that do not
hurt me that i can do a lot of
and then like that's what i've like
naturally gravitate towards like i can
do leg press all day it's like i used to
squat more weight right but then i
started doing like
30
30 work sets of leg press and my legs
blew up right and my squat went up even
though i stopped squatting
so i came back after doing a huge like
leg press cycle with bands and
everything right and i added 50 pounds
to my squat and i didn't even squat so
it's like i always heard these things
like leg press won't grow your shoulders
like i don't know well you're curling
when you're tired too and it's like as
ridiculous as that sounds yeah that's
working your stomach you know you're
doing these movements you're doing
a lot of movements where your body's
already fatigued it's a little
crossfitty almost yeah

91
01:30:00.000 --> 01:31:00.000
dude there's some crossfit tricks if you
see them like they're oh strong oh my
god
here we go
there we go yep
easy way
nice good press
there you go
is there a
is there a date you've got to be done
with this book
no it's like pretty casual
it's not casual but it's
uh
it's done when it's done formulated yeah
yeah it's more like
when it when it's worthy of the audience
i'll give it to him
and like we spent the last like 11
months have you written a book before
yeah yeah
um
spent the last 11 months
getting what i was going to say right
and so usually the writing takes the

92
01:31:00.000 --> 01:32:00.000
least for me it takes less amount of
time he's like i've written this book
six times
so i have six versions of this book and
then then i started and finished
and so this is version seven
and i think this time i got the pieces
right
so like
version six is like 85 right and then i
was like [ __ ] in this instance this
part's not completely
it doesn't apply you know what i mean so
i had to
rework the model or the framework
for uh people that are just tuning into
this and this is the first time seeing
you what's uh like
maybe a misconception of you you think
that might be out there that that just
because
people saw like quick videos on youtube
or a quick tick tock or instagram or
something that's a good question i feel
like that's a good idea there are a
couple misinterpretations like
that well i think one of them is
actually what joe said he was like so
you're like a business coach i was like
i'm not a business coach like we just
own businesses
so i don't coach anybody
the only people that like i work with
are companies we own right so that's
probably the biggest misconception

93
01:32:00.000 --> 01:33:00.000
because i get gmc so you more invest in
companies that's all i do exclusively is
investing and then once you invest in it
yeah you're invested in it and you're
going to help and well yeah then i'm
going to do everything i can to grow
because i'm literally vested part of the
team yeah 100 and so we act
so we basically built
this acquisition.com is a business that
builds businesses so i was thinking like
i look at warren buffett who's a big
hero of mine i was like okay how do i
take all the money i have and then
create a business where i can actively
work on the business while also
compounding my wealth and so i knew it
had to be something where i could mix
money with active time so if i make a
real estate deal i put money in but i
don't put any time in so i don't have a
lot of value out there like i'm not
gonna
i didn't make my money in apartment
building so i don't i can you know
conceptually i get it but like i don't
i'm not in it someone comes to me with
you know 10 locations of a
hair salon they got a cool unique model
they're like i want to get to 200 i'm
like we can do that like that's a game
we are good at if someone's like hey
i've got this you know unique way that i
help insurance sales guys

94
01:33:00.000 --> 01:34:00.000
triple their sales volume by doing these
three things that's different i have
this tool that helps them then i'm like
cool that's a business that i mentioned
to ryan on the way here yeah i have
these ideas all the time my wife's like
pump the brakes
she's like ken you and i together right
can we make that company better and i'm
like
i see you're you know and and like how
interested are you going to be in it for
how long right and so that's a good
question for people that are like
thinking of investing or if you have
someone that's going to invest can they
make your business better than where
it's at now so if they can't then it's
probably not meant to be so we look at
the person like do we like this person
what i want this it sounds terrible to
say it's like do i want this person to
be rich
and i'm like i want this this guy i want
him to be somebody who's an example to
other
so it's like that's peop one the second
one is like how big do i think this
opportunity is if it's something that
serves a very very you know can only get
to 10 maybe 20 million it's something
i'm not like
not that i won't help somebody but i
might not be as interested as something

95
01:34:00.000 --> 01:35:00.000
i think get to 100. it's a bigger
marketplace serves a bigger need
whatever and then the third one is like
what's my unique value at like this is a
great founder this is a great business
it's not my wheelhouse but you can think
of five other people that could help
yeah i could refer them or what we'll do
is just say like hey
i don't think that what i could do
merits the investment that i would want
to make to make this meaningful for me
so just this is what i would do
good luck so we'll give somebody even if
we're not going to work with them like
just our general plan of what we would
do
um because like caleb knows this because
he's been working for a while but like
we're big believers and like
it'll come back you know i mean even if
it doesn't come back
so all i did was help someone oh no you
know what i mean like for free yeah
like i'll die happy like it's fine so
that's kind of the thought process
behind it
i'll hit this last set
piston
nice set smoked it

96
01:35:00.000 --> 01:36:00.000
you know do
one draw yeah you want to do the 35 and
then burn it out sure all right
is there any other misconceptions
i was going to ask him because you see
the dm's in the comments a lot
thinking people think that you're like
uh the people think that you're like mr
krabs on spongebob all you care about is
money oh
well you know what i might not even
bother you but no yeah i've always been
really hesitant to say like i don't care
about money because i do care about
money yeah and i never want to get into
a situation where like he did that for
the money i'm like yep 100 that's what i
did for it so it's just like what am i
doing for the money so it's like i have
values as long as it doesn't contradict
value like i have
you know someone's like it cost them a
penny to make this thing they sell for a
hundred dollars that's
terrible i'm like
dudes i mean your price is on value not
off cost
so i don't that's just american because
as soon as you say that a certain amount
of profit is not ethical
you get into this really gray area where
i'm like what is what's okay 100 markup

97
01:36:00.000 --> 01:37:00.000
200 like is it 201 percent does he does
he end up in the dms at all or no
oh yeah yeah oh yeah
[Music]
mentor guru all of that kind of it's
just because that's the space which is
why we tried to like very consciously
say like watch yourself oh my bad i was
like we don't sell anything you know
like i don't have any courses i have no
masterminds i was i almost removed and
i'm still going back and forth and
removing the tag because i have a book
for 99 cents just because the internet
doesn't deal well with gray
with nuance that's the internet
find yourself defending yourself in your
dms no i know
i don't you spend pretty good with that
oh yeah
that's not right
i i lean more towards like yeah i
understand
because it's like joking with people or
or giving them good advice right yeah
yeah because i get cause i also get some
some of the companies we have are you
know they're founder-facing you know
they're face-to-face with slingshot

98
01:37:00.000 --> 01:38:00.000
right yeah and um people give them flack
and they're like and they get bugged you
know they get bugged by it and i'm like
i always feel like you get bugged by
stuff that you think there's a there's a
string of truth in it and so if i was
like mark's got pink hair he's a girl
you'd be like i mean
okay
all right
but if it was like i'm not saying like
if somebody you know johnny over here
you know rips off his customers and he
like has a terrible product doesn't
deliver support if johnny gets upset by
that then there's probably an element of
truth there yeah but if johnny hasn't
lost a customer and has that negative
turn this thing's doubling every month
because it's all based on word of mouth
you'd be like
okay
if he's known for having the best
customer service ever he's laughing
about it right and so it's like i think
there's gold in the comments if you can
like take the you take your ego out of
it it's like all the gold's there
but like if you get upset then it's like
that's a good indicator rather than like
i should get defensive it's like dude
you're right we're working since two or
three people say the same thing it's
like
yeah
and i don't think you should look at it
yeah yeah i think humans biologically

99
01:38:00.000 --> 01:39:00.000
are meant to do what social media does
on the plus or the negative like
we're social beings and so we feed off
of
feedback so like you're a kid and you
look around and you're like what does
that mean and then an adult says this is
what that means then you're like oh
that's what that means now what they
just said might completely be wrong but
like we orient ourselves with feedback
but then a lot of people can't take a
thousand people in a day telling them
they're a piece of [ __ ] it's just but
like biologically we weren't built for
social now we probably had interaction
with like 50 people right 100 people in
life and if 100 out of 100 people you
talk to you said you're an [ __ ] like
you should fix your behavior yeah but if
you've got a thousand telling you're an
[ __ ] and a million saying you're
amazing you still hear the thousand and
it hits the same so i think that that's
the and on the flip side the fame like
the crazy mania of like you're amazing
you're a god you can do no wrong you
know what i mean like right it's just as
if not worse
so it's like i think you have to unplug
from the matrix and say like none of
this matters
like all the hate
that's their worldview reflecting on me

100
01:39:00.000 --> 01:40:00.000
and all the positive is like i'm filling
a hole that someone didn't feel for them
but it has nothing to do with me
you know what i mean it doesn't make you
any more loved by your wife no right
like
that's what i share with people like
i have some friends that have like
they value like i guess what the stuff
i've done right
and they'll say certain things and i'll
say hey just to be clear
your wife doesn't love you any less than
my wife loves me it's the same you know
unless there's other things
but it should be similar right yeah your
mom and dad your family it's as long as
you got like a healthy family like it's
the same yeah uh there's not more he's
got more followers
right clayton christensen who was a
harvard business professor he died at
like 64 from cancer guy like killed life
like two-time national champion ncaa
basketball player harvard business
school then professor started founding
big businesses whatever and he wrote
this book called how will you measure
your life
it was a really interesting book where
he talks about like a lot of his harvard
business school like friends they only
measured their life with money because

101
01:40:00.000 --> 01:41:00.000
it was the easiest thing to measure not
because it was the most meaningful
and so he talks about how different ways
to look at measuring because when you're
dead or when you're 80 something you're
not like man i'm so glad i'm worth 10
billion instead of five
you're like man i wish my kid were here
yeah you know what i mean and so he
talks about you have your strategy he
said but where strategy mutual reality
is resource allocation so resources
being time and money it's like working
it's not going to be like that was so
sick my dad invested in 50 different
businesses
he's like he was there and he went
fishing with me he was there he wasn't
yeah exactly no totally yeah and so he
talks about like spending um
he said you can stay at la work late one
night and your marriage probably won't
be different like if you miss dinner one
night he's like but the problem is that
they'll sacrifice that like today thing
but they lose the long-term benefit and
they sacrifice that for the short-term
benefit of the promotion of the
recognition for a project he's like so
it's always an excellent thing we were
talking earlier it's like
short-term discomfort for long-term
achievement people usually don't make

102
01:41:00.000 --> 01:42:00.000
that trade they make it the wrong way
i'm going to burn this out 35 reps easy
i'm going for it
easy money
this is how you eat 800 carbs in a day
ladies and gentlemen
burn it all out lots of energy
[Music]
there you go yeah stick with it
shoulder veins popping up
roadmap that roadmap
exceeding expectations
going into the road
those veins right there that's the um
this is the injection site that you guys
been talking about

103
01:42:00.000 --> 01:43:00.000
that's how steroids work you get them
right into here you gotta get right
right in the main line the highway you
can route me later right so i can get in
well let's get the let's get the
slingshot what it's really for right on
there
did you tell them the story how it
started like you were injecting and then
you're like you know if i benched with
this thing on right tell them a story
about how you started steroids
i thought you said that's off camera
well they did call it the sling shot
that's right for a reason give it a shot
give it a shot
between that and the uh sling pin
you know but
swing shot sounded a little better
we can get funky with it oh
that's great
for my channel
when they do that it's actually easier
to get more reps in because you give
your off arm a little a little bit of
rest get a little breather yeah
so if you like finish your set and don't
you don't have any gas left you do your

104
01:43:00.000 --> 01:44:00.000
strong arm and your weak arm and your
strong arm and your weak arm and it
gives you like a half second in between
nice
it also rests down here for a half
second
get a little bit more
it's unbelievable the brand you felt
you're like you've built an unbelievable
brand
like you're
i mean like
you're beyond fitness there's like so
many people like in the street like you
say that bigger stronger faster like oh
yeah how did you um
like dude that was everywhere i mean
it like it like i mean it changed i
think it genuinely changed the narrative
around around hormones and training and
look at how many trt clinics there are
yeah
right like you really like like you know
when you think about like making a dent
like right
i'm not that you're not being morbid but
like if that's all you did was make that
one like it changed the the scene
thank you for that that's you know

105
01:44:00.000 --> 01:45:00.000
mainly my brother my brother chris he's
a director a bigger stronger faster but
it was a family
you know a family thing
and uh you know my wife was
really awesome with it like
when when i started talking about it and
she was like
i was like i want to talk to my brother
about this yeah on camera and her and i
didn't really
discuss it a whole lot yeah
she's like i don't think that's a good
idea yeah
and what's the upside right we're only
going to get hey it's all negative yeah
it's all negative
it's all negative i mean lying about it
yeah even if you're lying about it it
still seems like the best way forward
right because people have a hard time
handling once they've heard that yeah
for me
like stallone
arnold like because i was um
caleb and i had conversations and it's
like if you look at the the narrative
that most people will say it's like i
tried it once it's the same thing as
like barack obama and cocaine it's

106
01:45:00.000 --> 01:46:00.000
always like bill clinton like i tried
monica linski one time i tried it you
know what i mean but it wasn't for me
right uh so it's like that always seems
to be the only okay narrative to like
check the box but like
you know i didn't know when i was
probably like 1820 somewhere in there
when it came out i was like i had no
idea because i was like oh i thought all
these but i i thought bodybuilders were
natural i didn't know like i really did
right the ifbb because i just thought i
wasn't doing anything right i was like
man i gotta work out harder like
ronnie's much bigger than i am
well i mean we still know the truth is
that uh yeah
no one is uh without hard work you know
like yeah still need time and dedication
and all that stuff and as much as people
hear that they're like yeah but it's the
juice
and the juice is the juice and it gives
you a nice shot it gives you uh
it will help a lot
in a lot of ways but i think
you know my brother
you know making that film and my family
being a part of it was the biggest part
of it because
a lot of documentaries or a lot of films
like anyone can make one yeah but in

107
01:46:00.000 --> 01:47:00.000
this case when my brother started to
uncover
about stuff about falco and stuff about
some of these other
uh pro athletes that were doing stuff
couldn't really find anybody to talk
about it and he went to the producers
and stuff and he's like
we're not really getting good footage no
one's really talking about it he's like
maybe my brothers would talk about it
and then the producers they go
what
he goes yeah both of my brothers they're
on [ __ ] right now yeah and one kind of
struggles with it you kind of got some
demons from it yeah or not necessarily
from it but he's got some demons
whether it's from that or from somewhere
else and my other brother is succeeding
with it and doing pretty well and he's
taking over powerlifting with it yeah
they were like what the [ __ ] like can we
talk to them
and so they came and they talked to me
and i started talking about it real
authentically yeah
and my wife saw me talking with my
brother and saw the camera there and she
bolted out of the house she was
hysterical she's crying so we had a lot
of conversation i was like i really
i know that you might not think that
this is going to land anywhere yeah
but can you trust me i have a really

108
01:47:00.000 --> 01:48:00.000
strong you got to keep in mind like
we're losing our house like yeah we had
nothing she had no reason to believe in
me yeah i was like i need you to believe
in me for this i actually think that
this is going to make a difference she's
like why are you the guy yeah why are
you like let someone else ruin their
lives why are you going to take like the
bullets i said
i said from the information i have it's
a documentary it's a movie yeah so
from what they said i can't get arrested
or anything yeah someone can't take
legal action i'm not going to show a
shot camera
so there's not going to be much of that
kind of [ __ ] going on yeah
she was like all right [ __ ] it you know
go for it and how did so was it did you
guys um
you guys sign with the network and then
they
fronted money like i just don't even
know how it works they front money to
make the thing and then they distribute
it
my brother raised like around two
million dollars to get it going i had no
idea yeah that's right back before like
gofundme and like yeah popular internet
stuff that made it easy no way i did not
know that this is great this is so
interesting for me and uh alex bono was

109
01:48:00.000 --> 01:49:00.000
one of the producers of it he ended up
working for like snl and like he's done
a lot of very professional stuff so like
he's always conducted himself in a real
professional way and always kind of knew
how to go about doing stuff him and his
wife were producers on the movie yeah so
they also knew how to uh how to raise
some funds and raise some money but mark
cuban ultimately nobody's buying it
seriously i do i didn't know any of this
stuff yeah mark cuban bought it and mark
cuban owns
he owns uh movie theaters
so that's how i was able to get into
movie theaters nationwide
and again it's before like i watched it
on youtube i think that's why i ended up
watching it yeah hopefully you got paid
something for it i don't know i yeah
like my buddy my like my power team but
he's like dude you got to watch this
movie and i was like he's like dude
apparently like a lot of people take
steroids right he's like dude olympian
sticks over it's just like what
um like dr cashy is my close friend like
he did a lot of these the story hasn't
died you know it's still strong
yeah it's bigger stronger faster it's
still going it's just crazy that um

110
01:49:00.000 --> 01:50:00.000
it was so there was such a vacuum and it
was such a hush hush like
so many people
and no one was talking about it it's
kind of like um so i don't know if
you've seen on tick tock like the
pornhub like whatever the thing is it's
like they show all these scenes where
like someone just plays the the little s
the little jingle on their phone and
like the whole class stops and looks and
it's like this unspoken thing that
everyone knows about but i don't know
yeah but no one talks about it so
anyways i thought it was like it
definitely changed my life in terms of
like how i saw everything in the in the
fitness world so it was a huge
difference in one kid's life oh thank
you i appreciate that i was a huge
icebreaker for a lot of guys yeah they'd
bring their girlfriend or some views
would like bring their parents to it and
they're like yeah like yeah
what did you think it was like an
icebreaker to them to say like by the
way
trt or whatever yeah by the way i do
some of that stuff you know yeah well
now trt i feel like has been really very
normalized it's everywhere yeah just
like just normal like 100 milligram a

111
01:50:00.000 --> 01:51:00.000
week guys you're like they tested the
levels they're low and they just take
the
trt 100 milligram weak guy that's like
that sounds like a shirt yeah like i'm
100 milligram weak guy
maybe shouldn't yeah 100 million just
100 mg yeah that's it um is that what
launched slingshot
steroids
documentary oh it definitely helped you
know the documentary came out and uh
the documentary came out
trying to even piece it all together
yeah the documentary definitely helped
it it helped uh
you know when i went to trade shows and
stuff like that i was recognized yeah
walking in here but the inter but the
internet like
the internet as we know it now it didn't
happen yet yeah instagram wasn't even a
thing no there was no instagram
uh there wasn't really facebook at the
time there was like myspace
facebook i think was like coming around
but not everybody had it kind of thing
um so yeah just
the the movie made a difference
but like when people came and they were

112
01:51:00.000 --> 01:52:00.000
talking to me about the slingshot they
knew me a little bit more because i was
powerlifting and they definitely knew
powerlifting from the movie yeah so it
was like direct and a little indirect
yeah but i had a youtube channel going
like for many many years since 2000 as
soon as youtube was a thing
i had a youtube channel going on from
the very beginning and that helped a lot
too
is that your primary channel or is
podcast the primary
the podcast is is a primary channel now
just because of this
of the rate of growth you know how that
is like
i'm sure you have businesses like where
they do great and they bring in a
consistent amount but your focus is your
time is on some of these other ones that
are uh just launching my potential
faster yeah the potential is greater
yeah so that's where most of my uh
most of my time is spent more on the
podcast yeah we just started focusing on
our podcast more like
i mean the last six months and it's i
mean it's paid off like it's it's
interesting because like i like youtube
and podcast of all the platforms the
most even though we crank out a lot of
short form um because like to me like a

113
01:52:00.000 --> 01:53:00.000
single download it means so much more to
me than like an impression you know what
i mean because like you get
you know 12 minutes to somebody like
that so to me that's so much more
meaningful than like uh they saw a
thumbnail and that was it or they saw
two seconds you know it's hard right
it's hard to help anybody do anything in
in one second or an impression like a
headline's not gonna change someone's
life i think if if you think about like
you know why someone would want to watch
a podcast from you a podcast for me
podcasts from all these different people
right yeah um
maybe some of us are starting to overlap
and maybe we're starting to say the same
thing i think i heard a stat there's
like a few million podcasts right now
yeah it's crazy it's like they went they
exploded right they're all over the
place
but what's unique about it is that your
audience is going to want to hear more
from you yeah my audience is going to
want to hear more from you when we have
crossover
they could very well be like holy [ __ ]
alex is dope man i'm going to check out
more of his stuff
and then they they cross over into some
of the other ones but i think what is
also cool is that you get to bring in

114
01:53:00.000 --> 01:54:00.000
the unique people that you think
are important for your listeners to hear
from yeah and i get to do the same thing
and so all the shows are way different
yeah they're never the same the podcasts
are never the same and it's um we talk
about this on like on a marketing angle
for like paid ad stuff even for our
companies like the avatar of who we're
representing in like the advertisements
we're making it's like even if we have
two businesses that are like in the same
niche right like we have two accounting
firms whatever it's like if you have two
different avatars that are being spoken
to even the psychographics like you
could have two white dudes right i mean
fundamentally are both two white dudes
as the spokespeople that have two very
different messages and value systems not
that we're that different but like right
two different ways of seeing the world
and it will resonate very differently
you know i mean like you've got black
rifle coffee on one side and you've got
like starbucks right and like
both appeal to like upper echelon white
folks people on the same block yeah
phil's coffee and starbucks right flex

115
01:54:00.000 --> 01:55:00.000
you up
trying to grow up and be like you man
hey can i get a picture
i gotta be that guy let's get the guy
that keeps you the guy that keeps you
here an extra half an hour if he asks
for a picture
so this one i don't have you ever used
this thing
but for whatever reason
it just feels right it doesn't hurt my
wrists it doesn't hurt my elbows
and it just like it just feels right
this is the key to how you make a lot of
money is this tricep piece right here
this is literally everything okay yeah i
tell people all the time they're like do
i run ads i'm like no you do tricep push
down
too [ __ ] yeah
it just like
feels great
do any sports going up
yeah
wrestling
tennis
soccer

116
01:55:00.000 --> 01:56:00.000
martial arts
just um wrestling uh
i was a goalie and uh tennis oh that's
insane yeah those were my three
but all the guys i know who did
gymnastics all like are freaks
right i think they have this like
authentic awareness that you get when
you're a kid
and they always like keep it like they
have immediate form
when they start sports it's like a base
athleticism
i love these things that feels really
good yeah i like that so i don't want to
say this but uh i'm going to go down and
wait
because uh
it just feels actually i felt that a lot
and it felt really good
a good movement

117
01:56:00.000 --> 01:57:00.000
hmm
it's really important for people to
follow through on the stuff that you say
you're gonna do so
if you know going into the gym that you
might be short on time
then if you wrote down a couple
exercises to do that day
cross a few of them off before you even
get inside the gym so that way you don't
feel like you had an incomplete workout
and on the other side of that is like
just try to make sure you got enough
time to get all your [ __ ] in so you can
always follow through we've been in here
for a while today
and we've uh we've stopped a couple
times and
it could have been easy just to ditch
this last movement but it's like no
why not just follow through on what we
say we're gonna do
nice

118
01:57:00.000 --> 01:58:00.000
yeah there's something to that angle
you're right yeah i'm not like it's the
it's like the accessory i always wish i
had
like something about your wrist being
yeah it's this and it like it like
really cradles it yeah i don't there's
no brand on it i would i would tell
people about it but there's no brand um
yeah it just feels good because the
the rolly one some guy just like bent a
bar that way he's like [ __ ] it yeah
because the the round ones you're always
kind of like finding your spot
and then like i do like straps a lot you
know i wrap it around my wrist right i
like those
but this is still very comfortable on
the wrist yeah this just feels that one
feels good it feels like it sounds weird
it feels like a quad extension
like i know that makes no sense but
makes sense
feel more connected to it
man
there's a girl over there with a shirt
that says [ __ ] fat

119
01:58:00.000 --> 01:59:00.000
it's amazing
that's so great
yeah a little cut away
that one that shot that shot oh
[Music]
[Applause]
what
there it is
nice
nice
[Applause]
feels like it's getting way back in here
oh yeah i like i don't like i love this
i love this exercise
like i feel like i work the muscle like
i'm you know squeezing
[Music]

120
01:59:00.000 --> 02:00:00.000
there we go
how long have you been training a little
bit like this for
years a couple years and four years five
years when i did when he was talking
about the greg knuckles thing right
that's when i started doing this greg
kind of you guys thought about it
together he was just talking to me about
uh daily training for the same muscles
and how it like
made you stronger and build more muscle
and i was like that sounds good and also
like just filling up on glycogen right i
mean totally building out those glycogen
stores
getting that muscle pump so that was
like i started training this way
and i had a big breakthrough in my like
size so i had done like
power lifting five by fives
mad cow um
you know three two one like you know i'd

121
02:00:00.000 --> 02:01:00.000
done all the standard you know jug jug
method i've done all those ones and i
gotten pretty strong like that was after
i right after right as i was competing
you did the mad cow workout yeah matt
was that what is that called i don't
know i thought it was called mad cow
probably yeah
i thought it was called america
i don't know it was like this five by
five program
oh whatever it sounds amazing yeah it
was great i want to do it it was an
intermediate program by ripito or like
adapted from touch stuff
um
but then when i switched to
daily training and went from set to like
you know five and eight
to doing like seven sets of 15 to 20
every day
i got stronger and i got bigger so i was
like this is the [ __ ] right and then i
pretty much just like i stuck with that
because that was what broke me through
the 200 barrier like i couldn't get past
200 pounds like personal body weight and
then that i i got the 220.
and that was what that was like my big
breakthrough i was and i i didn't
when you ate that many carbs you
probably cut down on your fat a little
bit right oh it was it was supposed to
oh yeah really really low yeah yeah yes

122
02:01:00.000 --> 02:02:00.000
it was only trades but there's going to
be 30 years yeah from like oatmeal so i
spat in it you know
ah
so i'll show you something over here
with your trap
you might be able to do it right here
which yeah whatever side hurts uh-huh go
ahead and put that on there
just like mess around yeah like and let
me know like if it feels like [ __ ] it
feels like [ __ ] but yeah it might
oh
yeah it feels like a needle or a knife
so when when there's i mean you know

123
02:02:00.000 --> 02:03:00.000
some of this stuff but like when there's
injuries in there
the the fascia
gets mangled yeah and it will
unfortunately it will never repair yeah
it won't repair with stretching it won't
repair or strengthening
unless you like unmangle it
so we got strength and lengthen and
smash and this is a smashing this is the
smash that's a really easy movement that
you can get to yeah you can even get
into the back of it you know if you turn
around you can yeah you can dig in yeah
whatever
yeah whatever different ways or like
going here and if something's real
sketchy you'll know like you'll be like
oh that [ __ ] hurts way too much
it's really one to ten it's a nine right
yeah yeah exactly yeah that's a very
simple thing and i appreciate it do that
maybe twice a week or something it
should be all six lifters helping
lifters
that's right
it's amazing workout thank you so much

124
02:03:00.000 --> 02:04:00.000
bodybuilding is milo shark oh yeah
unbelievable yeah um
i loved him because he was always
he was confident he was only six weeks
out yeah and he trained all his athletes
to be like that he looked [ __ ] crazy
he did 68 or whatever the record was
kind of ifbb pro shows because he never
he never was in off season he just like
leaned out for six weeks just you know
got his hydration and went up but he
just what i always loved about him is he
talked about everybody else being fat
he's talking about other bodybuilders
yeah and they're like oh yeah that guy's
fat and you're like
guys like savage yeah this guy's like 11
body fat like he's not fat he was so
aesthetic he was he was one of my top
five for me i loved his physique i still
do love this
mike menser had a crazy physique remind
me of like similar 100 era you know
i love mentor specifically so funny
because totally different training
methodologies right because milos i got
some of my stuff from milo's too like
the giant sets right so like if i if i
didn't work out at a gym like this
because like in austin i had a
commercial gym that i just kind of like
yeah i just have my own gym
and i would just set up like my whole

125
02:04:00.000 --> 02:05:00.000
workout like we did
i would set the whole thing up and then
i would just
no break and i would do seven rounds and
then die
and distinctly pass out on the floor in
a position it holds out really good man
that's like invigorating like i i really
like that a lot oh yeah
this works for me there's something too
like just uh like i like doing full body
stuff it's pretty
normal for me to do that kind of stuff
but i don't really hang out on the
machines as much and it's like just kind
of brought me back i'm like i shouldn't
hang on the machines yeah they're simple
they're easy the quick
hit or get your palm it's easy to get my
uh like you said like lie to yourself
like if i'm like i got to do cabs and
then hamstring curls to like ease into
banded leg press or like a squat pro or
something like i'm like
well let me just do the first two and
i'll see how i feel and then i'm like
[ __ ] i might as well you know i mean i'm
here i'm pumped i'll go do it
