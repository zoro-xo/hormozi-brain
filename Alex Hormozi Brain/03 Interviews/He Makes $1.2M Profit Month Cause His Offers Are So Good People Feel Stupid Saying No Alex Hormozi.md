in three

today on the business method podcast we
have the author of the recently
successful and trending book for
entrepreneurs 100 million dollar offers
and his name is alex hermozy alex took
home more in a year than the ceos of
mcdonald's ikea ford motorola and yahoo
combined as a kid in his 20s using the
100 million dollar offer method in 18
months of business alex went from 550
000 to 28 million in the previous three
years alex has taken home 1.2 million in
profit every single month not year you
guys month
alex didn't start out this way he
started out as a small gym owner
struggling in the early days with
competition forcing him to sleep on the
floor of his own gym because he was
unable to afford rent anywhere else

10
00:09:00.000 --> 00:10:00.000
eventually alex started to learn and
implement systems in his gym to add ten
thousand dollars a month to his revenue
and over time he became the owner of six
gyms while everyone else was going out
of business once other gym owners saw
alex's success they started asking him
how he did it he quickly recognized an
opportunity to help existing gym owners
by sharing everything he learned the
this company called gym launch was born
in 2017 and it didn't take long for that
business to take off
alex and his wife started out traveling
from gym to gym helping owners build
more sustainable businesses gym launch
continued to grow to over 24 million
dollars per year with over 40 employees
servicing thousands of gyms and making
over 37 gym owners millionaires using
his consulting and methodology alex
reinvested everything into another
business that would further support gem
owners thus prestige labs was launched
in 2019. prestige lab started out as a
supplement company but quickly grew into

11
00:10:00.000 --> 00:11:00.000
another product line in 2019 they
launched done-for-you meals alex's
vision was to give gym owners the tools
not only to get their clients better
results but also make the gym owners
more money through commission unlike
everyone else alex didn't have great
funnels great ads or a wealthy niche in
fact he didn't even send emails until
he'd crossed 50 million dollars in sales
what's his superpower alex creates
offers so damn good that people people
feel felt stupid for saying no
today alex has generated over 120
million across four different industries
service ecom software and brick or
mortar and we're going to talk to alex
about creating the best offer for your
business that you could possibly have so
you can charge a lot more than you
currently are you can make products so
good the prospects find a way to pay you
and enhance your offer so much prospects
buy without hesitating he's on the
podcast today
alex welcome to the show man how are you
good thank you for having me it's a it's
a very nice introduction

12
00:11:00.000 --> 00:12:00.000
to it
i i think i hope you can too no i think
you really can um some quite often we
get people on the podcast and i do a
really good intro for them and they're
like man chris i need to bring you along
so you can open up for me when i speak
and do speaking engages
and um yeah but welcome to the show man
i i just got done with your book 100
million dollar offers fantastic book
read it in a weekend so anybody that uh
that likes a good quick in-depth read um
check it out and it's in layman terms
it's third grade third grade reading
levels so thank you for very much for
that and it's sketched out really simply
so we can all figure out and we can
apply it to our businesses and i
actually went through and kind of
created an offer of myself as we do in
the book it's kind of an exercise go-to
sort of thing so
so yeah i love the book and um we've got
an audience here we've got great people
to chat with
and and i think like the the best point

13
00:12:00.000 --> 00:13:00.000
to start is just how
you know where did you let's talk about
your background where did you get your
start at like where did all
where'd it all come from
um i had so i mean i i went to
vanderbilt um i graduated in three years
uh magnetic mladi only reason bring that
up is because i feel like a lot of
entrepreneurs who actually did okay in
school um somehow feel like ostracized
by the entrepreneurs who didn't do well
in school oh yeah yeah do you go to
college or not to go to college sort of
thing yeah we're like and i i'm actually
very against going to college um
nowadays if you want to be an
entrepreneur but uh
i think there's like you can also be
good at school and become an
entrepreneur as well and i feel like
it's it's been it's been so the pendulum
swung so far the other way that's like
if school didn't fail you then you can't
be an entrepreneur um so i don't know if
that's really true um but yeah i did
that and then i became a management
consultant um i was between that and
investment banking and i thought
management consulting sounded cooler um
and i it might still be cool i have no
idea uh but the two years that i did was
was not ideal for me i didn't really

14
00:13:00.000 --> 00:14:00.000
enjoy it that much um and it was uh only
in facing my own
desire to stop living um
that i was like you know i think there
are other things i could do that would
not make me want to feel this way
or would at least give me some chance of
not feeling this way as much and so um i
quit my job and then i emailed 40 gym
owners because i knew i liked fitness
one guy got back to me and then i drove
my car 36 hours from where i was to
where he was and i sold everything i had
before leaving and so that was what uh
kind of got me into the gym industry and
that was uh that was the first business
that i had was um was the gym and so uh
from there i you know really struggled
to figure out how to sell stuff um i was
it was hard for me to even give away
memberships and i was like
i gotta figure something else out
because this is way too hard and so um i
thought about you know and this was
honestly a combination of me talking to
lots of gym owners and luckily i didn't
have

15
00:14:00.000 --> 00:15:00.000
any friends or a girlfriend or a wife or
a dog i had nothing and i didn't know
anybody in the area because i moved
across the country and so as a result i
had a lot of time and so with that i
used every hour i could to drive and
visit gyms and visit other gym owners
and learn what they were doing and you
know piece by piece i was able to
assemble a better business um you know i
tried the stuff the stuff that was good
i used stuff that didn't didn't work for
me or whatever i i cast out and over
time were able to grow the business into
an actual business i think by month nine
i had the whole gym outsourced um and
then every six months after that i
opened a new location off cash flow and
that was kind of what
what started to create the reputation
for me um was was opening each gym at
full capacity on day one which is
actually pretty interesting i explain
how i did that but um and that was kind
of what gave me some notoriety and um
but i i invested every dollar back that
i was making into new locations and then
i ended up
i think in the book i allude to it i
ended up losing all the money from
selling my gyms um shortly thereafter so

16
00:15:00.000 --> 00:16:00.000
i basically had four years of my life
that almost just disappeared within a
matter of like 30 days
which was awesome highly recommend um
for interpersonal growth um but what i
was stuck with or left with were the
skills and the beliefs and the character
traits and so i think that those are the
those are the things that we collect as
entrepreneurs far more than the assets
we accumulate um and i think ultimately
that was why the next thing that i did
was so successful and then you know
everything after that has been pretty
good how old were you at the time when
you started that first gym
23. okay
and
you met you said you sold some of the
gyms and then lost all of that what what
was that like for you
um when you sold the gyms and then lost
all of that i know pretty much all
entrepreneurs that reach a decent level
of success lose a [ __ ] ton of money
right it's just kind of like
you're going to have to lose a lot of
money sometime in your life if you're
going to be an entrepreneur right so
so as a young guy like what was it like

17
00:16:00.000 --> 00:17:00.000
for you and if you want to share like
how much money was it
oh i mean it wasn't a ton i think it was
like
it was like a hundred grand maybe 150
grand but it was everything i had that's
a lot for somebody in their mid-20s
right yeah um
and so it was yeah it was just it was it
was i mean it was miserable um but i
think what it was so it was
i don't know how if i can describe this
the right way but it was so painful
because it was like the only thing that
i felt like i had to show for it
that it forced me to think differently
about what i had to show for it and so
in thinking differently to cope with the
pain i think i made better realizations
about what i actually had to show for it
which is all the skills that i had and i
think that that is if there's anything
that i can pass to entrepreneurs it's
like the entrepreneurial journey is far
more about the the character traits of
skills and beliefs that we collect along
the way than it is about actual business
that we work on and i i have a saying
that i like a lot which is like the work
works on you more than you work on it
um
and i think that that is very true and
if we if we see it that way then it
means the work itself is the is the

18
00:17:00.000 --> 00:18:00.000
result um and then it it releases us
from the outcome-based thinking that
ends up destroying our businesses
because it forces us to think longer
um because we already have achieved the
outcome by doing the work
i love how you put that i love how you
put that and it's so true too because
like once in my life i was donating
plasma and eating cans of corn and green
beans for dinner you know and i was like
you know one day i'm still going to help
people and i'm going to keep doing this
entrepreneur thing even though it's it's
it's not easy
so that takes us to
so
you you had the one gym sold it lost a
bunch of money and then um
i had six gyms you had six sold all six
of them and then lost a bunch of money
right yes and then in that money where
did that go what were we reinvesting
into other business ideas
yeah so that was part of how i lost it
so um i also fire sold so
this all of these kind of so
people like to tell linear stories but
they were much more

19
00:18:00.000 --> 00:19:00.000
mushy i mean like that thing started and
ended as all entrepreneurs at the same
time and so um you know my gym launch
started in april of 2016 um is when i
founded the business um and then i spent
that year flying around and launching
gyms right actually doing gender rounds
but i still owned my gyms at that point
okay and so
i you know so it's
a little more a little more muddled
right um and at the same time i had when
i started gym launch i i that i think
the month before i started it i joined
um
russell brunson's inner circle was like
five years ago yeah and i got up and i
was like hey this is how i feel gyms
this is how this my plan to get from six
locations to ten locations i already
have the locations picked out and i
wanted to be like america's gym so i
owned united fitness and that was kind
of the plan
and so um the biggest gift that he gave
me and i've said this many times um is
that he shifted my perspective and he
said
alex i think you're really good at this
i think you have a level 10 skill set in
a level two opportunity

20
00:19:00.000 --> 00:20:00.000
and um that hit me really hard but i was
like huh he's like i don't think you
should be running gyms i think should be
teaching people how to do what you do
and so um
that was kind of the first kind of pivot
and that was what took me from
running the six and then
moving to selling them all within the
next you know six months or so um got it
so that obviously was really hard for me
because it was everything that i built
at that point and it was completely
shifting my vision for what i wanted my
life to look like um but i'm a big
believer that you know if you pay
someone for
mentorship if i do not listen then i
might as well earn the money uh and so
you're paying someone for advice and
you'll take the advice
a good a good use i mean that being said
take it with you know green assault etc
but i think what he said made sense to
me and so um i took the i took the
plunge so you said too you were so busy
like you and your wife were so busy i
think girlfriend or fiance at the time
flying around non-stop that you you're
almost forced to
to start
you know saying here you do it on your
own i'll teach you and
and figure it out

21
00:20:00.000 --> 00:21:00.000
right
like you know that happens to a lot of
us because we we're running these
businesses they turn into jobs for us
and then it's just to the point of
frustration where we're like
we have to hire somebody or we have to
tell somebody to do it on your own i'm
still going to charge you but i'll walk
you through it but i can't be there in
person sort of deal i can't hold your
hand anymore
the way that you were right
we um it's that that's a that's a much
cleaner uh version of yeah yeah okay
okay what ended up happening was um we
were launching gyms for
honestly the dates are muddled for me i
think the first one was like may of 16
and i think last one was march of
or april maybe it was april of 7th so it
was about a year-ish um but it felt like
longer because it took me before i did
the first gym i had to like find the
first gyms and then set the dates and so
it's like and then i had was dealing
with stuff afterwards so it felt more
like 18 months
but um we we were launching the gyms and
there was a week where
two of the six or two of the seven gyms

22
00:21:00.000 --> 00:22:00.000
are something that we had launched that
month the gym owners had gotten up on
like their stools in the middle of the
classes that we had just packed
and just told everyone to just refund
and go home
and so the issue was i was the one who
controlled the processing so i processed
sales that we had generated for those
facilities and so
i got a hundred and fifty thousand
dollars in refunds in about a week
between two facilities
and so that was about all the profit i
had at that point because i just started
again at zero like not that long ago um
after losing everything the first time
so this is really just me losing
everything again
um
and so i was like you know what i'm i
think i'm done with the gym industry
like it's been a ride i was just like
emotionally tired of it and so we were
really good at selling weight loss
obviously and so layla who was my
girlfriend at the time she had a little
a little weight loss business like
coaching online i said how about i just
direct all my attention to this let's
see if we can scale it and just go
direct to consumer and so within about
14 days we're doing a thousand bucks a
day selling digital products 14 days
yeah wow i mean amazing what happens

23
00:22:00.000 --> 00:23:00.000
when your ass is against the wall and
you need to do [ __ ] um so it started
working so i was like okay cool i'll
take the eight sales guys that we got on
the road we'll bring each of them in we
can do a thousand day each we'll do 8
000 a day or 240 a month this could work
you know like we can do this
and so that was the plan and so um i had
eight gyms that were supposed to launch
the next month so eight guys who fly out
and we do the turnarounds are on all of
them it wasn't just layla and how we
scaled the team up um
and so when we were launching uh i
called those gyms up and said hey you
know um we're not gonna be doing this
right and the first guy was like dude
i need this i just mortgaged my house
again like i maxed out my credit cards
like i need this to work yeah um and i
was like dude i'm not i'm not coming out
i'm sorry and um he's like please help
me somewhere and so that was when i was
like well
i thought you know what i'll i'll show
you what i'm doing but i'm not gonna fly
out there to save your ass if you can't
sell i'll show you how to do it and he
was like okay that's fine that's fair
uh how much and i picked the highest
number i could think of at the time
because i didn't want to do it and so
this was i ended up unlocking high
ticket pricing by accident because i

24
00:23:00.000 --> 00:24:00.000
didn't want to do it and so at the time
just to give you perspective the highest
price i could think of at the time was
six thousand dollars and so i said for
six grand i'll i'll i'll show you how to
do it and he was like okay and i was
like i just like i remember like looking
at the phone
and
and i was like holy cow and then i and i
so then i called the next gym that i was
supposed to to to get rid of you know
like to not launch um at the same
conversation he was like how much and i
was like eight grand and he was like
okay and i was like holy [ __ ] the next
call same thing i was like 10 grand he
was like holy you know he said yes
the next call i did was 12 grand and he
was like yeah and i was like this is
unbelievable and so we made um i ended
up making 60 grand that day
um
and
i remember looking at layla and i was
like i think we're still in the gym
business i was like i think we're just
doing it wrong and so over the next two
days i didn't sleep
and i made everything that that i that
was missing from my because i already
had a training for the gym owners for
after we left on how to manage the
clients and how to upsell them all that

25
00:24:00.000 --> 00:25:00.000
kind of stuff then i had the sales
training for my team on how to sell the
memberships because i had them i they
needed to be able to sell uh because i
was pumping real money at them and like
spending hotel airfare rental car food
ad spend commissions every day i was
spending 3 300 today as you know from
the book and so i needed them to be
successful so the sales training is
still one of the core sales trainings
it's like the training that i had for
those guys was a good sales training uh
because it worked and so um
anyway
uh i had to just create the other aspect
of it which is like how to generate the
demand what the ads look like how to
market it et cetera and so um each of
those gyms made thirty thousand dollars
on average in their first thirty days um
and then that's when it just blew up and
then yeah you know we had more demand
than we knew what to do with um i called
the other 30-something gyms that we had
launched over the last year i was like
hey remember that thing i did where i
filled your gym up i was like you want
me to show you how i did it they were
like okay and so i just resold all those
the next month and then and then just
the the word of mouth
was huge and i think it's well
um

26
00:25:00.000 --> 00:26:00.000
professor bergerman who's the mba from
stanford uh bergamo trap um
talks about it's more dangerous to not
know why you are successful than to fail
and know why you failed
and um i think what i think being the
subject of a lot of uh
screw not scrutiny um uh interest a lot
of people have have have cast their
opinions about why we were successful
and i think what is wildly undervalued
um is that our product was exceptional
and i think that is what people do not
understand in the
internet space as a whole if you can
call it a space
um is that there is an over emphasis on
promotion and an underemphasis on
product right and if you have a good
product the amount that you get back
from your promotions are significantly
higher and what i find ironic is that
the book that i wrote is not a marketing
book it's a product book um but it is
marketers who are reading it
right the book is a product
doesn't talk about how to get leads it
doesn't talk about messaging it doesn't
talk about copy

27
00:26:00.000 --> 00:27:00.000
headlines literally talks about how to
make a product yeah but no but there are
no product books in the marketing space
and so it's like for a lot of people
it's like this brand it's like the
product is a thing right
it's a marketing title right that
catches them and gets them in just like
yeah yeah go ahead
and so that's the and so um that is what
is still to the state and as i've
continued to weather and and age as an
entrepreneur uh the business that we
look for now to invest in as a part of
acquisition.com are companies that have
superior value propositions like how
good is the thing
if the thing is good um then it's very
easy for me to build all the other stuff
around it
was that the same timeline when that
started to take off on that side when
you went from 550k to 28 million or was
that the the year following that later
so time would be did um 2018 we did 28
million and 17 million dollars in profit
as a 28 year old so
um it's not lost on me it's nuts
and then the next year we did 37 million

28
00:27:00.000 --> 00:28:00.000
i think we did 13.5 million in profit
that was when i started the supplement
company so i invested in all the
inventory all that kind of stuff i also
made one really massive pricing mistake
which cost me about four million dollars
which sucked
which i can happy to talk about if you
want
and then 2020 uh we started we at the
end of 19 in the beginning of 2020 we
started allen which is our software
company we actually um
yeah
throw the software company um
and uh scaled that to just under two
million a month within the first six
months and then um
and then in the middle of kind of 2020
is when we started acquisition.com um
and that was that was the
that was when we started it now we have
um three companies outside of the
companies that i own um explicitly that
are in that portfolio yeah
before we move on because i want to
start to dissect the book but
um i want to ask you and i talk i ask a
lot of entrepreneurs this but it's
fascinating to see
so much rapid growth

29
00:28:00.000 --> 00:29:00.000
in somebody's timeline
because i think mindset wise so many of
so many people out there just get stuck
at like the six figure mindset or maybe
half a million mindset or seven figures
or or you know even eight figures right
and and and you were almost forced to
kind of blow that mindset out just by
circumstances but what do you think are
some of the best things that you did
throughout your timeline to help you
shift your mindset rapidly and then
accept that oh i'm an eight-figure
entrepreneur right now i'm a nine-figure
entrepreneur right now what any any any
any things that happened or any tidbits
or or tips you got from anybody or
courses or mentors or anything that
really kind of kind of helped you
through that so
interestingly like i've never it was
just funny you said that i've never
identified as a quote eight-figure
entrepreneur or a like i've never said
those words like in my entire life right
i've never even
um
and so that just figured out at least
address that um but i'm actually a big

30
00:29:00.000 --> 00:30:00.000
believer in the theory of constraint and
so
it's
i think what appears quick to the
outside
fast from the outside feels like clarity
from the inside right and so when you're
inside of this it's are we clear on the
one thing we need to be focused on right
now what feels what what feels fast on
the inside is slow on the outside it
feels like everything's so frenetic and
of all these things i have to do and if
you have all these things you have to do
and you're not prioritizing and i think
that ultimately like all of us are all
given more or less the same resources
we're most people here in a developed
country most people have access to the
internet
we have access the same information we
have access the amount of time
and so why is it that some people are
able to outperform others and it's
because of how they prioritize their
time
and um or rather the actions that they
do and so
when i look back on 99 of the decisions
that i've made in the last year almost
none of them mattered um but the one
percent of decisions that did matter are
the ones that a lot of leverage on and
so um i think you had the original
question was how how do you break that
mindset of like speed etc um
i think i focus not on what the outcome

31
00:30:00.000 --> 00:31:00.000
is but is what is the constraint that is
stopping us from growing right now and
so i think if we ask better questions
we'll get better answers and most people
don't even ask the question which is
um if i'm at a hundred thousand a year
what is stopping me from being at a
million dollars a year what is stopping
me from being at 10 million a year and
um i do like grant cardone's concept of
the whole 10x thing and i think i like
it because it forces us to ask better
questions if you say how do i double
you're going to get doubling answers if
you say how do i 10x the answers are
different
because you can't do twice as much you
can't start you can't do 10 times as
much as what you're doing you have to
think differently and so i think that
when we ask those types of questions
then we'll be able to answer them and
have those better answers and then
execute on them and i think that the
actual drive though which is different
than what you're asking but i think
still equally important is that for me
um i was just incredibly insecure
and
really wanted to be
untouchable from all angles
mostly just to protect myself because i
think i'm soft on the inside and so i

32
00:31:00.000 --> 00:32:00.000
try to portray as much
unbeatableness as i possibly can mostly
so people just leave me alone
mm-hmm
for me that pain is what drove me right
um i think that i think people are
driven proportional to their perceived
pain irrelevant from what actually
occurred
in whatever created who they are i think
everybody's had quote uh you know
difficult times in their lives most
people have difficult childhoods and
that's because you're a child in the
real world with no coping mechanism so
of course it's hard for you right um but
we all experienced that and then the
question is to what depth did we
experience that pain and then
what did we use that pain for or did
that pain use us
have you targeted what what that pain is
for you exactly and oh yeah for me 100
was approved for my father that i didn't
think i was good yeah
and and as you've gone through this
journey have you
learned to accept that that pain more um
or come to terms with it or even let go
of it or
i think that over over my

33
00:32:00.000 --> 00:33:00.000
so i had to i had to go from pain to
numb
um and then from numb to selectively
turning on emotions again
um and that was probably a a four-ish
year process no that's not true it's
probably more like an eight-year process
so i'm thinking about from gym launch so
from the original me starting my gyms
until maybe like a year or two ago
um it was it was rage that that built
the gyms and it was fear that built gym
launch
and i would say that
ego probably built the software company
and then i think
acquisition.com finally
um is coming from a place of
abundance and i'll define abundance
because i think people throw the word
out a lot right but abundance is as i
define it you need nothing it's not
about how much you have it's about how
little you need and so i think that you
can be abundant because by definition if
you need nothing then everything is in

34
00:33:00.000 --> 00:34:00.000
excess which allows you to give because
i don't need anything in return
yeah
and sometimes it takes all that trial
and error and fear and rage to get to a
place of abundance right to really know
how to tap into it and appreciate it
mind you i made millions of dollars off
fear and pain so like i'm not saying
that it is not an effective means of
motivation and i think
another interesting thing is that people
don't know the difference between
motivation and fear
and what happened that's interesting at
some point some of you hopefully will
experience this is that when fear
disappears motivation actually feels
different and i don't think i'd ever
felt motivated until maybe recently
because it was still fear that drove me
so like that that that thing inside of
you that's like i gotta start working
that's usually fear not motivation right
it's fear of some sort of failure
insecurity or judgment or whatever your
thing is
so how do you know like if you're
feeling uh fear and not motivated like
do you have a do you have something you
do to switch like you wake up in the
morning you're feeling fear you've got
to do this this this this
um is there something you do that can

35
00:34:00.000 --> 00:35:00.000
help you switch on a regular basis i
don't feel i don't feel fear nearly as
frequently now that could be because i
have put real world totems in place
that kind of quell those fears and
insecurities so it's like
so like just being real for a second
right it's like i look the way i look
right
i'm very wealthy i'm young i have an
attractive wife um whom i enjoy
and so i check off all of the boxes that
i think that are important for
perception and i think that i could
stand here and say ah it's because i'm
so secure now or
i just quality insecurities with
changing the environment in which i live
so that i can just continue to function
and have real evidence to contract or
contradict the fears or insecurities
that i speak to myself in my head um
well put
all right i love this but we've got to
dissect the book
let's talk about offers we got some
listeners that want to talk about offers
um so your book you have three or four

36
00:35:00.000 --> 00:36:00.000
main sections pricing value creating uh
your value creating your offer enhancing
your offer and an execution and starting
off the the the thing that pulls people
in from the book you end up talking
about product but you're tired you start
talking about how to make an offer so
good that people feel stupid to say no
and me personally i've experienced this
um a handful of times when the offer is
so good just people walk away just
feeling
really you know silly for not buying it
right now and i think that's what we're
all trying to get at but some of us
aren't that great at creating offers and
you call that a grand slam offer
and and i love this part in the book
alex i actually wrote it down while i
was reading it but
you said no offer no business no life
bad offer negative profit no business
miserable life decent offer no profit
stagnating business stagnating life good
offer some product okay business okay
life grand slam offer fantastic product

37
00:36:00.000 --> 00:37:00.000
uh fantastic profit insane business in
freedom
and it's never been like cut out like
that for me before and i've been an
entrepreneur for over a decade right and
i've never seen offers laid out
in that description so it was really
eye-opening eye-opening for me
so so maybe if we can just dive into
exactly what a grand slam offer is and
how some of how the people out there can
really start to form their own in a
better way
so i think it's useful from uh from a
thought perspective to to show extremes
um and then kind of walk backwards from
there
so
if i wanted to so let's if we wanted to
start with the query um i want everyone
to say yes right so what would i have to
say to get everyone to say yes and so
let's say i was selling a make money off
them right which fundamentally anybody
who's b2b is selling to make money right
it's just down and said differently but
more or less that's what it is and so if
i were to say cool um i guarantee you
that you will make
twice as much money as you do now um in

38
00:37:00.000 --> 00:38:00.000
30 days or i will pay you all of the
money that you paid me plus twice as
much back
right and you don't have to do anything
besides buy today
um
most people would say yes to that right
and so the question is
if we if that's the offer someone say
yes to
is there and then the other offer is pay
me right now i give you no promises
there's nothing you might experience an
outcome you may not right you're gonna
have to do a lot of work and it's gonna
be really painful for you
if that's the other extreme
is there a point in between here and
here that's closer to this side that we
can um do
that will get people to buy and that we
can fulfill and so i think that that's
kind of the thought experiment is like i
would start here and then just walk back
as few steps as i can until i find
something that i feel like i can fill on
that i know most people will say yes to
and so the components of each of those
things is what's kind of outlined in the
book and so um the first section of the
book is around pricing because

39
00:38:00.000 --> 00:39:00.000
i think a lot of times
most entrepreneurs like there's four
major marketplace i don't talk about
this in the book but there's four
marketplaces that exist within within
like pricing strategy you've got at the
top you have luxury
then you have premium
then you have low cost and you have
ultra low cost ultra low cost is like
third world country like 99 cent book
that i have ultra low cost right
uh low cost is walmart it's amazon is
target right
uh premium is uh bmw mercedes right audi
those are premium luxury is rolls royce
right and so
the i mean i probably should have just
done all car examples there but it would
like the the lowest one would be like uh
cars they don't even sell here in
america and only sell for like under
four thousand dollars in india yeah i
mean like that would like they don't
even exist here and then we only have
like the pinto or whatever you know
that way right and so
the idea is that it's not that

40
00:39:00.000 --> 00:40:00.000
i want i want to just color this for a
second
the reason i give the broad advice of
raising prices is that for most
businesses they're not going to win
unless they're a more complex
entrepreneur that's funded etc right
which most of us are not
um with some sort of ultra low cost
strategy because they can acquire market
share etc most people normal service to
a normal avatar and if that is you then
you don't occupy any of the four spaces
and if you're selling a normal product
to normal avatar you're probably not
intentioning to create a luxury business
which is one where the more someone pays
the more status they have which you may
think that because you are expensive you
are a luxury but you are not right so
it's clear like
demand should go up when you increase
the price and that's not the case for
most people and so the idea is if you're
in the normal then you need to decide
whether you're going to be low cost
whether you're going to be walmart or
you're going to be premium like you're
going to be bmw right that's the
decision most businesses need to make
and most of them try and do something a

41
00:40:00.000 --> 00:41:00.000
little bit more for a little bit less
and they find themselves in the middle
which a consumer does not understand and
so we have to decide what we're going to
be and i think that if you're going to
be the low-cost leader there can only be
one or two per marketplace and so unless
you have a very strong operational
background and you've dedicated all of
your effort to how can we optimize costs
and pass on those savings to the
customer so we can give the the highest
value per dollar
then the only kind of reasonable
alternative besides that is to become a
premium leader and so i don't describe
that in the book but that is the
reasoning behind the the broad the broad
brushstroke recommendation of just
becoming a premium
leader which means you have to increase
your price and the benefits of
increasing the price are that you're
going to attract more qualified
customers and when you attract more
qualified customers your product even if
you don't change it will increase in its
quality if i attract uh people who are
doing a million dollars a year and i try
and help them go from one million to two
million it's significantly easier than
helping someone go from zero to ten
thousand dollars a month right right
because it already has all these other

42
00:41:00.000 --> 00:42:00.000
things and so i might have the exact
same product let's say it's how to run
facebook ads which i think is the most
commoditized thing in the world but you
get the idea right so if i how to run
facebook ads and i'm trying to consume
to go from zero to ten thousand dollars
a month it's much harder and my product
will not do nearly as well or provide
nearly the value as it might to somebody
who's doing a million dollars they get
one thing from it and it boosts them by
25 percent it's 250 000. so for them i
can in a real way provide more value and
my product was more valuable because of
the prospect that i'm choosing to sell
to and so that was kind of the idea
behind the the pricing component of this
and then when we have more pricing power
we can spend more in the acquisition we
can spend more in the fulfillment and
then fulfill the promises that we're
making and then actually feel like we're
we're we're making the impact that many
of us want to have when the reverse of
that is you have less profit left over
you have to cut down on your expenses
you provide less value and then in so
doing you lose conviction then
ultimately burn out
so you have one quote in the book alex
and it applies to this where you say
there's absolutely no benefit of being
the second highest um

43
00:42:00.000 --> 00:43:00.000
the second cheapest uh service or
product in that industry or in that
niche but there's a ton of benefit of
being the most expensive right and this
is
and i guess that would regard both
premium and luxury
areas of of price range okay cool
and and and that's where you decided you
wanted to be
uh using that method basically you
decided you wanted to be the most
expensive company out there that helps
gyms launch your businesses right makes
sense so much so that people have to
stay they have to pause and think wow
this is so much more expensive than
everything else i've seen
something different must be going on
here and in so doing you can use price
even as a as a primary signal to a
prospect that you are different like
price in itself can be a differentiator
even in the opposite direction
right that makes sense uh but then you
still have to deliver on the back side
of it or you'll lose business eventually
like that's the only way to sustain it
right so so i guess the next part of

44
00:43:00.000 --> 00:44:00.000
pricing is is finding the starving crowd
and so and you dissect this in the book
as well so the starving crowd being a
crowd that you know the hot dog stand
outside of the baseball stadium at
midnight or whatever and people are
really really hungry and there's no
other food
and um
it seems like you kind of almost
naturally kind of dropped into a
starving crowd and this is just from
what i know from you of the book i could
be completely wrong about that but i see
a lot of entrepreneurs that that
struggle finding a starving crowd or
here's the other thing they kind of get
their
their ego or their concept of themselves
wrapped up in a non-starving crowd and
they continue to build a business that's
that is for a non-starving crowd and
maybe a crowd that's really you know fat
and hungry they don't even need your
service right
so
so let's hone in let's talk about
how people can find a more starving
crowd
so four components um which are in the
book is one is that if like what are the

45
00:44:00.000 --> 00:45:00.000
components of this right of a starving
crowd and it's not always going to be
perfect but i at the very least want to
make sure that i'm not in a dying market
right so the first is is it a growing
market is this market either growing at
the pace of the marketplace or growing
faster right if it's growing faster
that's plus right if it's just growing
the same then i just consider that a
neutral point and if it's shrinking then
that's something that i'm going to say
is a red flag and i might not want to be
a part of it so an example of a
shrinking industry would be newspapers
right which i think for example in the
book and a friend of mine had that had
that business um an example of a growing
market might be cannabis right it's
growing faster than the marketplace
because it's meaning the demand right
and you use the 99 real quick nine
percent rule as whether it's growing or
dying is that yeah okay so nine percent
what the stock market returns on a reg
on average on a regular basis and so
yeah and so if if the if you're not
making more than nine percent a year
you're not growing you're dying correct
yeah yeah okay exactly yeah and so
that's the that's the growing component
um the second is do they have buying
power right um it's the difference let's

46
00:45:00.000 --> 00:46:00.000
say i was a relationship i changed this
example in the book it's like if i were
a relationship coach i would rather deal
with uh you know finding your second
half of life love with old timers then
uh uh well not alzheimer's for old
timers um then uh then like find a
hookup made in college because that that
marketplace has more purchasing power
even though the problem is the same so
i'd rather deal with that
um the third component is are they easy
to find
and this one's important um because this
is more of a tactical example but like
if you can't find your market or they're
just more difficult to find um they
don't have associations they don't have
lists now nowadays with the internet it
just
usually just takes a little bit of
ingenuity and sometimes that can be a
competitive advantage if you find
something that might be a little bit
harder to find but you find a way to
contact those people then that can be
that that can be like secret sauce for
you um but i want to make sure that i
have a way that i can easily target them
um and ideally a way to target them that
is cost effective right
and so um i was trying to assure the
visual in this puppy um for

47
00:46:00.000 --> 00:47:00.000
for our uh for our growing marketplace
maybe i can find it it's my book i
should probably know where it is um here
it is
so
for everyone who's watching so you've
got um and i'll get to this one last but
you've got the pain you've got the
purging power you're easy to target and
that they're growing right and so i'm
doing these in reverse order but pain is
the is the last but also maybe the most
important one which is
i don't want them to
be aroused by what i'm saying i want
them to be ravenous um for the thing
that i himself right and
that comes down to timing so right now
if you're asked is the gym owner market
um a starving market i would say maybe
in that they have pain but overall i
think they tend to be jaded by the fact
that like a hundred other gym launched
copies have come in
um to the marketplace not delivering on
the promising but still trying to keep
our premium pricing um
and so
i think timing matters right timing
matters a lot when it comes to these
things and i think we also um to a large
degree had a lot of our success because
the timing was good um and as much as

48
00:47:00.000 --> 00:48:00.000
people want to be like oh it was all our
entrepreneurial prowess i think part of
it was timing i think there was a lot of
things that you know facebook ads were
cheap uh clickfunnels had just started
um you know what i mean like there was
there was no one really doing what we
were doing at that time and so a lot of
those things
volapalooza together to create a really
outsized outcome
yeah but from a marketplace standpoint
if everyone here is looking at their
niche that they're trying to find
which is probably the next point
and the pricing is that we want to find
a niche and um if you want i can go
through that pricing example because i
think it's powerful i'd love to yeah
so right now i use weight loss a lot
partially because i come from that
background but also because everyone
understands it um
if i were selling a generic wait
actually no that's not the example in
the book i'll use it i'll use a weight
loss example do something different so
if i had a generic weight loss product
right i might be able to sell that
product for like 19 to find an e-book on
weight loss right that would be just as
mark is just weight loss right there's
nothing crazy about it if i were to
niche down and say um i want to do
weight loss for women then it might be
something that it's only for women that
i might be able to charge maybe 99 for

49
00:48:00.000 --> 00:49:00.000
that same thing right if i were to say i
want to work with
women who are
nurses or shift workers
um and help them lose weight and this
diet plan is specifically for that type
of woman then it might be a 500 thing
right
and then if i said i'm working with uh
shift working nurses
um between the ages of 35 and 55
um in
you know highly urban areas or something
you know whatever um then the pricing
power of that thing might be a 2000
price for the same thing and ultimately
the ebook is going to say stop eating
[ __ ] and move
but the thing is is that the prospect
will perceive the solution is far more
tailored to them and the messaging can
so clearly articulate their pain in a
way that they feel understood and if we
can talk in that way then they would a
very real way get more convicted that
the product is going to work for them
and then in a very real way we'll get
and receive more value from the product
because they perceived it as being
tailored to them and so we can take the
same product

50
00:49:00.000 --> 00:50:00.000
a weight loss ebook and make it 200
times the price or whatever a hundred
times as expensive as it was before
simply by niching down and
selecting a market that we believe now
in that example that i would say that's
an easy one to find they have purchasing
power because they would be nurses so
they probably you know they're making 70
to 110 000 a year um
they're in pain because they're
overweight right and they and they have
a lot of other pains of like their time
and their scheduling and all the other
pains i would try and hit on um
and they're easy to target right and so
i they would check all the boxes i'm
sorry they might not be growing but i
would say they're growing at the pace of
the marketplace i don't know if maybe
maybe nurses are in a lot of demand
right now okay so who knows that might
for right now it might actually be a
growing market um but that would be the
idea it's like okay if i'm looking at
this and i'm currently selling weight
loss or selling it to everyone how can i
sell it to one person um and how do i
pick that person well and a lot of times
i feel like entrepreneur
entrepreneurship is very
counterintuitive which is why a lot of
people don't succeed at it it's like
you have to give more in order to get

51
00:50:00.000 --> 00:51:00.000
more it's backwards yeah yeah people
think it's all about asking it's all
about giving right um you have to say
who you're not serving in order to find
who you are going to serve right and so
strategies are about saying what we're
not going to do rather than we are going
to do and so there's lots of lessons
like that that are belief shifts that i
think are important in the
entrepreneurial journey and the first
one begins with who we're going to sell
our thing to
yes that makes sense that makes sense
okay um
there's once okay we can dissect this
more but there's one story that i i
think
in the book you
shared really well
how people created um
grand slam offers and it's when you went
to arnold schwarzenegger's house
i believe for the first time and you
were there for his charity event which
you're now i think you're a board member
of this charity all-stars
um what was all-stars i forgot the name
after school all-stars yeah that's right
and you went and you don't i think you
donated a million dollars or something
and you were just rubbing shoulders with
all these really impressive people what
were some of the things that they were

52
00:51:00.000 --> 00:52:00.000
doing i think they ended up raising 5
million at that auction or something
like that what were some of the things
that they were doing
that the
the entrepreneurs out there can
can use
um to get these really high prices and
um
for a product that they perceive is
really worth it and and apply it to our
own businesses
so i'll add a little bit of color to
this that i i
cause whenever you write a book there's
always i could have said this here i
could have added this
right
yeah that they did um that i would i
would add into an updated version which
i'll probably do later
um is that philanthropy in of itself is
something that can help you command high
premiums or you'll get a you'll have
more
people will buy things if they get
because what happens is in a real way
they're getting more value because
they're getting value from the product
and they're getting the value from
feeling good about donating something
and so there's two types of value that
they're getting and with philanthropy
the more you give the more you get that
value in terms of how much you gain now
i'll tell you this it's not proportional

53
00:52:00.000 --> 00:53:00.000
but
um
but anyways uh they had a philanthropic
edge which made everything everyone
always feel good and they're in the
right mood there's and the biggest one
this is what i kind of beginning begin
the whole i use that story as the
entrance to the chapter of enhancing the
offer is that scarcity and urgency are
two of the most powerful forces scarcity
in my opinion being almost the most
powerful
um of forces that that produce pricing
right and so um
the story that i tell is uh i was there
they introduced me to a guy named george
he was one of the biggest donors um
besides us and um
they had told or george was in the hot
he was a luxury good seller so he was
selling million dollar two million
dollar watches or timepieces as they
call them
um and
he was a master of understanding
scarcity and pricing
and so
he understood that there was more demand
this year for
attending the charity event
and i think in the year prior they had
sold um

54
00:53:00.000 --> 00:54:00.000
i want to say
i can't remember what it was but it was
a lot you know a few more tickets than
they sold that year but for ten thousand
dollars and so what he told them to do
was with more demand to cut the supply
he said so whenever demand goes up he
said you cut supply
and so by doing that they were able to
two and a half x the price they charged
for the tickets and they still sold out
even faster
and by doing that i just remember i
tried to display it in the story in the
book but like i remember how much it
like it impacted me because i was like
man like and this guy has made zillions
of dollars understanding this one
concept
and
i'm trying to give an example which is
like if i were to say right now hey um
i'm gonna do a workshop right for for 10
grand for five people i could probably
have that filled in 60 seconds right if
i made a post right um because i don't
do that um but at the same time if i
were to say i will take one person for
as much as i you know as they were
willing to pay me for a day um i've had
people offer me 250 000 for a day um

55
00:54:00.000 --> 00:55:00.000
and so i would actually have made
five times sorry 25 times the money or
five times the money excuse me um by
just selling that one person and still
have the four other people who might
have originally purchased for ten
thousand dollars wanting to buy again
later and as long as the first person
gets an exceptional experience even more
people would find out about it and the
next time i might sell two tickets right
and so the idea is how can we always
stay
ahead of our supply demand curve so that
we always have fewer spaces than is
demanded of us and so what happens for
most entrepreneurs is that they have an
itty-bitty minimum amount of demand and
they immediately need to go for the ask
right
the idea is the longer you can delay the
ask the more demand you can
build up and then you just open up the
door just a little bit and then close it
that's a little bit closer right and by
doing that that is how you can have
unbelievable pricing power right
right it doesn't work
that's a that's a that's a service-based
perspective obviously or if there's a

56
00:55:00.000 --> 00:56:00.000
one-time or limited edition but the
thing is and i put the strategies in the
book for for creating this kind of
scarcity is that there are still ways
and this is probably the most tactical
one that i can give on here is that
right now um
if you have a client based business and
i were to say
i'm gonna send you a thousand customers
like you have tomorrow
you would probably not be able to pick a
number but that i'm just using that as
an extreme example for most people
so
most people probably have a certain
amount that they could probably
maximally handle and do a good job
and so the ethical way of showing and
creating scarcity is just actually
saying what your limit is and so if you
normally can handle let's say five
clients a week then just saying that
five clients a week is your limit and
then actually enforcing that limit and
this is the thing that people [ __ ] up
and actually enforcing them or even
limiting it to three and then increasing
the price so you have fewer people to
service you have less operational cost
and more margin because again the goal
is not to sell the most people but to
make the most money right right
with that right we can then after we

57
00:56:00.000 --> 00:57:00.000
tell the first person we're like we have
two spots left for the week and after we
throw the second person like this is the
last spot i got a handful more calls and
you are being truthful
and so you put a genuine dem uh scarcity
line and here's the cool thing is that
next week you can change it to four
yeah but if you just as long as you
ethically stick with the line that you
draw you can always say exactly the
amount of spaces that you left which is
normally what you hit anyways but it
creates the perception of scarcity which
can can get more people to buy when they
otherwise might not
yeah
it's so difficult too like it's
appealing there's a carrot in front of
the horse's mouth and you're like oh one
more client an extra five thousand ten
thousand dollars i can handle it as
opposed to just saying no this is where
i'm going to limit myself and then scale
that but it's it's difficult for people
to do
i can put you on the waiting list for
next week if you want yes yeah that's a
good way and then as soon as you text
them next week what do you think is
going to happen they're like [ __ ] yeah
i'm in it's like yeah we ran
right or next month whatever
um i want to dive more into uh the last

58
00:57:00.000 --> 00:58:00.000
part of the book execution but we're
going to leave that for the end of the
podcast we've got some audience q a
right now so we're going to bring
some of the guys in that want to ask you
some questions aaron nunez hop on in
buddy turn on your video and your audio
and then you can uh say hello to alex
and go ahead and ask
alex
what's up
i've been a huge fan for a couple years
now read a bunch of stuff
i love your youtube videos uh i just
wanted you to dive into if you can get
into more specific and how you removed
yourself from your from gym launch as a
personal brand i got a ton of questions
around that like one
it looked like i i saw an ad it looked
like you basically brought in another
guy to replace you as the face of the
company and why did you choose that
instead of just like a company brand
and then not only that what was it what
was it compensated how did you take over
like how did you manage the research and
development i imagine jim launches a lot

59
00:58:00.000 --> 00:59:00.000
of research and development like how did
you
put that into the operations and then
not only like where the like i know you
said profits went from like 16 million
to 8 million like where did that go did
that go to like is it decreased revenue
or just your profit sharing it out or
what did that look like it's a good
question um so there was a lot of there
so i'll try and start at the top um well
i'll start backwards you know what i'll
do in whatever order it comes to mine so
to answer the profit question part of
that was because we just got kicked in
the nuts with covet so i think that the
i think the decrease would have been
significantly less if we were not brick
and mortar gyms during covet for that
year right so i think it's somewhat
unfair to say that the team was somehow
half as effective as they were otherwise
um but during that period of time um we
still did do you know all the
replacements that i was referencing the
individual that you're talking about has
been with us for five years and was a
customer first so he's been in our world
for almost five or six years now right
and so uh he was a customer did the
experience turned his stream around sold
his gym successfully came on board as a
sales guy became a sales manager then
became general manager of the whole

60
00:59:00.000 --> 01:00:00.000
company and so he's been getting groomed
this whole time right um for this and
then at a certain point
i think the entrepreneurial journey in
general is a relinquishing of control
right and so
a lot of it comes from the emotional
side of the entrepreneurs that we have
this desire to control things and have
things in our way when you have to get
over that right it's hard that's why
most people don't do it so that's hard
they always want to jump back in it'd be
so much easier if i just did it myself
it's like yeah it would be but you'd
also continue to always do it yourself
until someday you let someone else do it
from a compensation perspective the
executives in my company have phantom
stock
and so they get a percentage of stock
every year
which is you know usually
generally so i'm not going to share
their compensation but i'll say in
general rule of thumb um it depends on
the size of the company obviously but
you can usually have like a a half a
percent or a one percent per year
vesting uh with a one year cliff what
that means is that they don't get
anything for the first year and then
after that first year they'll get that
first percent and then every quarter
thereafter they'll get you know 0.25 or

61
01:00:00.000 --> 01:01:00.000
or i'm just using fake numbers here but
that that would be the idea um and then
after that you cap that at like year
three or four and then the idea is if
they have three percent of the company
after four years because they have one
year that they had to earn it um
then after that that like the the growth
of the company itself is going to be
where they're going to gain like their
three percent will become more valuable
if the company's twice as valuable right
um and so that is and obviously they had
they have they have bonuses and they
have um
uh and the bonuses we split between
company performance and individual
performance so we try and split those 50
50. so i'm gonna i'll give you round
numbers um just for illustration's sake
so let's say it's let's say the person
is making uh 200 thousand a year that's
their targeted income right
uh so 200 000 a year is what they're
making 100 000 a year might be base 50k
would be based on the company hitting
company objectives and then 50k would be
based on them hitting their personal
objectives that they have sold control
over so if the company does shitty then
but they still hit all their stuff they
get half of what they could otherwise
have achieved on the flip side if they
do a terrible job but then the company

62
01:01:00.000 --> 01:02:00.000
still crushes it they still probably had
some if they're in a leadership level
they still probably had some
contribution to that and suddenly they
would get the other 50 right and so but
they'll have a base of
you know whatever it is which is about
half of their comp now that's going to
be dependent on the type of person this
is a conversation that you'd have with
an executive some executives are more uh
risk-averse and some are more
entrepreneurial and want to have the
higher upside potential for higher
downside um so it really depends on
their appetite for risk uh and that's
more of an individual conversation and
figuring out what they value um a mentor
of mine actually had an executive that
he felt like you could never
incentivize with money and then he
finally had a long like long walk on the
beach with him and he was like i just
want my kids college to be paid for and
so he just paid for all the guys college
kids so like i think it's the incentives
is far more about finding out what the
thing is um that drives them more than
one cookie cutter approach
um but yeah and then in terms of how we
turn it from a personal brand
um into what i would consider now just a
gym consulting company um is one is that
people try and do it way too fast right

63
01:02:00.000 --> 01:03:00.000
like this was a like he had already been
with us for three years and then it took
about two years from when we said this
is when we're gonna start to now where
we're completely out
um it took two years and it was like
okay well alex is gonna go from taking
five calls a week to taking three calls
a week and then two months later it's
gonna take two calls a week and then
another month is one call a week and
then it was okay well now i'm just
taking calls for the higher level
clients and then from there it's like
okay i'm not taking i'm doing every
other call right or then it became now
i'm just doing the big release calls and
then it was okay now i'm not on any
client facing stuff but i'm still in the
portal i'm still running the ads not me
running this but i'm in charge of the
marketing component of it it's like okay
now we have someone else who's going to
charge the marketing equipment and i'll
just film ads four hours once a month
right i'm telling you these are the
transitions that we went through um and
then it went from me not filming the ads
at all which is where we are now um to
finding someone else who can film this
ads and then also what i
what i call creating the gl marketing
machine and so for us there are there's
a lot of material that is consistently
generated by our community which is good
marketing material
and so we have onboarding calls we have

64
01:03:00.000 --> 01:04:00.000
testimony you know we have coaching
calls we have success calls that are
recorded every single day
um
that we can we can slice and dice those
things and they can tag them as like hey
this is a good call and the marketing
team can come in slice off the piece and
then make that into an ad and all of
that is consistently being generated
without any effort and it's just about
capturing and tagging it which is much
easier and so by doing that worry about
you've probably seen me have tons of
testimonials that we've run for years
right we've run new testimonials every
month and it's because we have fresh
testimonials to run and so that
always works um because at the end of
the day like the best kind of proof is
social proof of other people just like
the avatar and so um that is that is
ultimately like kind of like the process
that we went through and then and then
once we were completely internal facing
it was okay um now layla and i only talk
to the two you know the three executives
um in the company and we meet with them
uh twice you know i meet with one of
them for 30 minutes and then we meet
with all of them for 90 minutes once a
week and that's what it is now
cool uh

65
01:04:00.000 --> 01:05:00.000
we have to bring in another question
here erin if you have some more we'll
circle back to you if we have some time
so
this very thorough man um okay davis you
want to hop in davis nguyen
yeah absolutely alex appreciate you
coming on love the book as well as love
your podcast that's why my gym routine
is listening to like three episodes and
continue on with that
so funny thing i'll tell you management
consulting at least i think it's cool
just because our business actually helps
people become management consultants we
work with vanderbilt as one of our
places where so my question for you is
that i'm really looking forward to
volume 2 where you talk about pricing
models but for a service like mine which
is placing students into managing
consulting roles how would you think
about the pricing on that one
so
if i were placing so are you so you you
take
okay so let me let me make sure i
understand it properly so you go to
elite schools you look for the people
who didn't get jobs and say hey there's
these lucrative you know career path

66
01:05:00.000 --> 01:06:00.000
here we've connected with bain mckins
you know whoever you guys already have
your um your consulting relations with
and then you put them through what i
would consider some sort of training
that makes them more valuable than they
currently are and then those companies
are happy because you know that you've
you've done a lot of the onboarding
process for them so their cost
of bringing them up to speed is probably
a lot less and so they can start
generating revenue from those people
faster and they're a little bit more
vetted
um because you've taken them through
whatever process you're taking them
through am i understanding that
correctly at a high level yes the only
two things is that even for a mckinsey
bain boss consulting group and so forth
they'll still need to go through the
interview process and getting the
interview so what we do is we have a
team of coaches who will help them
polish their resumes help them with the
interview and then they hopefully pass
the number which we've gotten a good job
of so far
so still let me ask you more about that
so is it are you selling them basically
how to increase the likelihood that they
get in into those into those businesses
is that more what it is yes that's more
of that okay got it no it's good for me
to understand i wasn't sure if it was
being sold
we're finding the people who don't get
in and then and then kind of

67
01:06:00.000 --> 01:07:00.000
selling it as an opportunity or it's
like this is more of an improvement
offer of what you're currently doing and
make it more likely it's just it's an
important distinction um okay so this is
actually really similar to test prep
which i um
almost started instead of gyms because i
love the test prep business unbelievable
margins but anyways um
so how do you position the offer there
so the idea is i would i would i would
have some sort of guarantee around the
number of interviews that they'll get
um if i can and you could make it a
conditional base guarantee which is like
um or we'll keep working with you until
you get at least three interviews so
that means that when you sign up you
know that you're going to get this um no
matter what whether it takes six months
or it takes you know six years now
obviously at a certain point they're
gonna lose interest because they're not
good enough but it still makes it still
has some element of decreasing risk now
that would be a conditional guarantee
you can also stack that with a
unconditional guarantee of um if you
don't believe the value of our service
in the first 30 days we'll give you all
the money back anyways right and so then
from a pricing perspective the question

68
01:07:00.000 --> 01:08:00.000
is are you selling to students are you
telling your students parents
we're selling to students but obviously
most of them will go to their parents
right okay cool so um there's a i mean
there's a zillion different pricing
models you can do with job placements so
i mean you can do a percentage of their
future income you can i mean there's
lots of things you can do um
i mean that's that
that's limited only by your creativity
um but i would probably have some sort
of combination of front-end and back-end
so front-end engagement to cover my fees
and acquisition costs and then probably
all my profit will be on the back
yeah that's what we currently have right
now and i'm thinking about switching it
which is we collect one-third upfront so
you're committed and two-thirds once you
get the offer but after reading your
book this weekend i was talking about
the idea of huh what if we do the
reverse which is we collect everything
up front but if you don't get it after
certain methods and so forth here's a
refund
yeah i mean you could do that too like
these are these are the beautiful thing
about testing these things you know what
i mean um
yeah i mean that's the like we just test
stuff and i i tend to try and make the
offer

69
01:08:00.000 --> 01:09:00.000
so good i'm scared and that's usually
when i know it's right
i love that i'm gonna call
that helpful that's super helpful as a
hey thanks chris
cool
thanks davis uh victoria's up next
victoria hop on in
hey alex
really a pleasure talking to you big fan
girl read all your books watch your
youtubes as my morning inspiration every
morning pretty much
anyways um i have a question regarding
um when you come into the companies
because through your acquisition.com
uh company you you
basically buy a stock in the company and
then you come and scale them so i'm
wondering when you come into the company
where do you start the transformation
process do you start in the product in
marketing in hiring proper team like how
do you go about that it depends entirely
on the business
so i've i'll give you i've got two
companies that one company i already
have and one company that'll probably
take equity in the next few months that

70
01:09:00.000 --> 01:10:00.000
are similar they're in the same space
one of them is exceptionally good at
acquisition and not very good at product
and increasing ltv the other one is
really good and has grown almost
entirely off word of mouth but is really
not good at acquisition so it just
depends on kind of the point that i was
making at chris earlier is that it
depends on where the constraint is in
the business and so we just try and
focus on what is the one constraint what
is the thing that is limiting the growth
of this business and i think properly
identifying that is where a lot of the
expertise comes in because when you're
on the inside of the business you have a
hard time because you have so many
things that are going on and so many
things that you think aren't good
because because the reality is a lot of
things aren't good right i mean a lot of
things are not perfect but the question
is which of those things that is
imperfect is the thing that is limiting
the business and so which is what is the
greatest fire that we have to put out
first and then we put them out in
reverse order um some some fires are
more silent and some are more obvious so
like um and
a lot of times it's also like just
differentiating between symptoms and
causes right so for example a business
might not be growing as fast as they
want it to grow and they're like well
i'm not getting a lot of customers and
it might be a product issue and so

71
01:10:00.000 --> 01:11:00.000
that's where kind of judgement and
discrimination on behalf of like our
experience and having seen a lot of
different businesses and whatnot comes
into play it's like do we think this is
a product issue or is this a marketing
issue right or is this a team problem
like you said um so it really kind of
depends or is it a model issue like
the first business i took on
um
uh was a photography company and uh the
guy was like i have a working
photography business they were doing 1.6
million a year out of just a single
facility is 2000 feet i was like this is
awesome and you take it from 300 000 to
1.6 million because of the gym launch
book uh he just executed everything in
the gym lunch book and photography
business which i thought was funny um
but anyways uh he had started his
parallel business and he was doing
i think 500 000 a year and mind you for
everyone who's on here we don't take
anyone at that size anymore like
everything's five million enough but
just
let me continue the story and so um it
was it was apparent that he was very
good at the business but the model that
he created was some sort of like
semi-hybrid agency thing which like
everyone tries to do and is really
commoditized and generally shitty and i
had no desire to be a part of it and so

72
01:11:00.000 --> 01:12:00.000
we reconfigured the entire model and now
14 months later it's doing 200 000 a
week
so they're doing 10 million so they just
cracked a million
and so
um
that was one where the team was right
the marketing was great the product was
great they just said they were just
monetizing completely wrong and so we
just had to restructure the model i have
to change anything besides just here's
here's how we're going to do money now
rather than changing anything of the
actual doingness of the business and so
it really depends
on the business like it really depends
and i think that's where i mean that's
candidly where a lot of the value that
we we can provide comes in because we
know where the bottleneck is and we can
just de-block it and then move forward
which is why the growth is so fast in
some of the companies is because
like um
the like one of the companies i think
will do 35 million this year they're 85
next year um that's my guess
just that one company alone um and it's
because like they just had this one
thing that they didn't know how to do
and we know how to do it really well
which is build a massive scale sales
team and so we're just installing a
massive sales team which will allow them

73
01:12:00.000 --> 01:13:00.000
to four or five x their prices um and
probably double or triple their
conversion from the front end because
they don't need to go to a purchase they
can go to a call which will double or
triple so i'll triple the volume and
triple the price
amazing do you have any like shortcut
checklist that you go like this is good
this is good this is not good let's
start here
i think i think of them in sequence um
so it's more like let's start at the top
of the funnel so how are people finding
out about us so it's really like i just
walk through the customer journey and
trying to figure out where the whole
thing is
not enough people are finding out about
this you know
why and the or is that okay this is not
good enough and when people do find out
about it they don't want to they don't
want to buy it and so you actually have
you have a negative marketing campaign
that's counteracting your positive
marketing campaign
that makes sense
cool okay thank you i have more
questions if there is time
okay we'll we'll let's greg hop in
victoria and circle back if we have some
more time
thank you victoria
greg go ahead buddy
hi alex my name is greg buddhist nice to

74
01:13:00.000 --> 01:14:00.000
see everybody um thanks a lot chris uh
my name is greg i own a jewelry a
company called the jewelry republic
which is my b2c brand and i have my i
have a factory here in thailand which is
where i'm calling in from um
so my question is regarding uh
philanthropy and
and working in the charity space
i do run a profitable business but i
want to i want to ask your thoughts from
what you said earlier with working and
regularly folk giving proceeds to a
particular um you know maybe a
non-profit so that i'm their partner and
we work together
and and obviously when i write them a
check or give them some finances in a
very loud and proud manner is it do you
have any pro tips or any experience
um with growing your business with a
purpose
i'd say acquisition.com is the first
company that have grown with a purpose
besides making money
okay

75
01:14:00.000 --> 01:15:00.000
let me let me reverse that real quick
so
i think there patrick lincione has a
book called um the advantage which is
really good i highly recommend it and uh
in the book he talks about there are six
main reasons that you can start a
business
um and i'll try and remember all of them
right now off the top of my head but one
of them for example is like i want to
better the community so you might be
somebody who's like i'm starting an
insurance business but it's because i
want to i want to i want to help the
latino community in this area right now
i have that my insurance practice um you
have that same insurance practice and be
like i want my employees to all become
wealthy right that's something that i
care a lot about so that might be the
reason that the company exists it might
be that you are passionate about
insurance in general and believe because
you had some traumatic experience and
you broke your neck and insurance saved
your life or whatever um and so you
believe that everyone should have
insurance and that's the reason that you
start the insurance company um
there's um
uh
like there's like two or three more but
that's that's and one of them is wealth
right like you actually just want to
make money um which is another reason

76
01:15:00.000 --> 01:16:00.000
like a lot of venture capital firms
legal firms tend to be kind of more in
touch
and i think what's what's important is
um and so like the companies that i've
had have had a purpose um but
that that
in some way all in my opinion all
capitalistic businesses must have a
purpose if they're going to grow
otherwise
satisfy your immediate needs for
financial security which i'm assuming
you have already satisfied if you're in
the space that you are
um then they're all in a way they're
philanthropic if that like i know that
sounds weird but like i think in some
ways a lot of capitalistic businesses
that become big um are that way because
most employees are not motivated by
money they want to make sure that
they're making a difference as well um
but you can be
more overt about it um i think you
should be over to the messaging
regardless but if you have a
philanthropic um edge to it which is
kind of what i'm doing with
acquisition.com but not as
a donating um from a money directly but
more so i'm donating all the stuff that
i have for free which is kind of the
point why i'm doing these you know
podcast like this um

77
01:16:00.000 --> 01:17:00.000
is because that's the cause that i'm
that i'm i'm passionate about and so i
think that as long as the messaging
across the entire company aligns with
everything has to align with that why
then i think everything will operate in
alignment you'll recruit the better
people and then ultimately like that's
the that's the stuff that all the
marketing community doesn't want to talk
about but it's also the reason that none
of them are big um is that they don't
understand culture they don't understand
motivating people they don't understand
alignment um and they don't and and like
the only way to build a big enterprise
is people right which i'm sure you you
already know and so and so having that
philanthropic alignment actually gives
you in some ways a lot of competitive
advantage in my opinion
well that's really an amazing input and
thanks thanks a lot i mean with my my
community's all military former military
guy
i want to be the veteran i am the
veterans jeweler and i want to be able
to obviously support them serve them but
we've got a lot of veteran problems so i
want to take a chunk of what we make
profit wise and give to them but just in
sort of a way that says hey i'm just not

78
01:17:00.000 --> 01:18:00.000
you know buying lambos which i'm not
against either but i also want to make
sure my brothers and sisters out there
you know they can better their by
something that i can provide
and it sounds like
it's a perfect cause right so that's
actually that's one of the ones that i
missed which was the you're you're
either about the industry or about the
avatar
so you might not be like like the the
point of the jewelry business might not
be jewelry the point of the business is
to help veterans and you do that
through the vehicle of jewelry but the
end result is that you're making
veterans lives better right and so that
would be the fifth one of the of the
different reasons that you can start a
business like it's the avatar it's the
industry um it's the community it's the
um your employees uh it's wealth um or
it's a general cause right and so yours
is that you love the avatar which is
awesome
and so i think that i think that your
perspective on it is dead on um and i
would just align the uh the messaging
component because i mean it seems like
you already have the messaging pretty
much down um because i mean that is the
message like and it becomes more and

79
01:18:00.000 --> 01:19:00.000
more and more about them unless it's
here it's just uh
but i think what you just said right now
to me is very clear and so it's like we
are veterans this is how we do it um and
this is why you know this is why we do
it and then the vehicle of how we do it
is through is through the um if you've
watched simon's next uh start with why
he's a really good talk on it i think it
might actually be really useful for you
thank you thank you thank you
thanks greg victoria has one more
question and we'll start to wrap things
up
yeah thank you alex i want to i want to
ask a question regarding selling by
phone so in all of your books you refer
to selling as being a very valuable
skill and i agree but i would like to
know your perspective on what do you
think is that threshold in dollar
amounts that it's worth actually putting
together sales team and starting selling
by phone rather than just doing your
typical you know email selling by email
and
what is the dollar amount depends on the
space
depends on

80
01:19:00.000 --> 01:20:00.000
depends on the space so if i'm selling
weight loss the ticket would be lower
than if i'm selling investment
opportunities
right so i'm specifically thinking about
language learning space i'm helping rave
live linga we want to move from
just selling you know by hour to
offering a program
and whether it's worth it or not to go
on a phone for let's say 300
yeah i think offering your program is
way better because you're selling the
outcome no one wants because think about
this think think about how crazy selling
by hour is the more hours you sell the
more time and effort i have to use which
means the more i have to buy the less
likely i want to buy it
exactly the more crazy that is right
like the longer hours you sell the
longer it's going to take me which means
my time delay increases with my effort
and sacrifice so the so literally you
have two value components that are
counteracting your pricing
right
so i would say yeah so i think having a
defined end program um with being able
to pass a basic language that's that you
can put together
right could be the guarantee which is
that you'll pass our level one test that

81
01:20:00.000 --> 01:21:00.000
you can control right um
and you can do that i mean i don't know
the the time duration because you would
know about it 12 weeks
three months
yeah 12 weeks or six months or whatever
it is and then you can sell that and
then the outcome is i pay this money and
then i will be able to pass this test
which to me is valuable right or it
might be like vacation level so you
could have little levels of like you
know i mean you know this better than me
but i'm saying like i would probably
think like i have a vacation level which
means i can go to that country and not
get killed right and know where the
bathroom is and know how to like order
at a restaurant right and so that's what
you can pass and it takes 12 weeks so if
you're going to buy this trip and then
you can anchor around the price of a
vacation
right so if you might have a 5000
vacation it's like it'll double the
value of your vacation if you know what
to order and how to get around and
you'll have a way better experience and
like why would you not why would you
spend an extra thousand dollars a night
all right 200 a night on a better hotel
but the whole time you're there you hate
the experience because you can't
communicate with anyone and you can't
really soak in the culture because you
don't understand what's going on right
and so then i would probably try and
anchor around that so in terms of price
point
um

82
01:21:00.000 --> 01:22:00.000
i'd probably say for your space i mean
this is me just pulling it out of thin
air like with no no background data but
probably a few thousand bucks probably
two grand three grand is probably the
minimum i would i would charge for
something getting into that in that
range and it depends again on the
fulfillment like if i had if i if i had
a one-on-one person who was helping me
out or is it am i following a curriculum
and then someone checks in with me for
the verbal you know 20 minutes a week so
it kind of depends on i don't know how
your thing is structured so there would
be some business components from a cost
standpoint that would come into play
there but out for for a business like
that i would make sure that i was
probably running 95 percent um net
margins are higher i said gross margins
are higher so if it cost me just for for
perspective so let's say it's 20 minutes
uh weekly right and it cost me whatever
i don't know 50 bucks an hour so i know
that that guy can do three per hour
right so it'd be um
uh 16 17 bucks right so 17 is what it
cost me to get the 20 minutes and
they're gonna get 12 of those so let's
just round up and say 20 bucks times 20.
so i'm sorry times 12.
so 20 times 12 weeks is 240 so that's

83
01:22:00.000 --> 01:23:00.000
going to be your hard cost um of
fulfillment right and so if i want to
run uh you know 95 gross margin it means
i have to be 20 times as expensive as
that so 20 times times so it'd be got to
be a 4800 product if that were the
fulfillment
yeah that makes sense i actually
calculated all the net margins based on
your formulas that you're providing
yeah
but you're you're not really in the
service business or at least if i
wouldn't make it i would try not to be
in the service business i would try and
be in an assisted
uh
assisted media learning business which
is you get a lot more leverage a lot
more margin
yeah exactly we're in uh
it's exactly that it's one-on-one
coaching with all the assisted materials
and everything else
cool and i mean mind you me saying that
price is like i'm thinking that way but
at the end of the day the value the
price you're going to charge is based on
the value the market will perceive so
like i'm saying that that would be my
minimum that i would want or i'd have to
reconfigure my you know maybe 90 might
be the lowest i would drop for a model
like that

84
01:23:00.000 --> 01:24:00.000
yeah thank you
thanks victoria alex we'll start
wrapping up here um one thing i want to
point out is the the last part of your
book where you talk about execution and
you tell this really great story um
about when you got your first hundred
thousand dollars in your personal bank
account yeah and i think that's a
pivotal moment a benchmark moment for a
lot of people a lot of entrepreneurs
when they get there because we may have
it in a business account we may make
100k in rev and those are all you know
benchmark moments as well but when it
hits your bank account and it's yours
tax you know taxes are over with and
everything it feels really good
and it's easy to get wrapped up and
motivated by these numbers 28 million
128 million 1.2 million a month profit
you know people are like yeah i'm going
to be there next week and but sometimes
we lose focus on it's like okay the
first step for a lot of entrepreneurs is
just getting that first hundred k in
your bank account under your name and so
what can you tell a little bit about
that story what it was like for you when

85
01:24:00.000 --> 01:25:00.000
that happened and how everything shifted
yeah
so um
for everyone because everyone sees
overnight successes right um i had now
at that point been in business
for four or five years like for context
for everyone so it seems like you know
alex is everything together but i mean
it took me like four years to get there
and at that point i'd already done
multiple millions in revenue
um and per year with the gyms
but because i kept always wanting to
reinvest stuff and so the most valuable
lesson that i got from losing everything
twice
was was that
a lot of times we tell ourselves this
illusion
that we're going to pay ourselves later
right
and
the companies that i have had that have
been the most successful this is my
experience and there's probably other
entrepreneurs who might who might
counteract this who are maybe far
wealthier than i am but this is my
experience as a small business owner i
was able to scale
is that if the business pays you and you

86
01:25:00.000 --> 01:26:00.000
and you go in with the intention of the
business paying you you'll you'll be
able to last a lot longer
because because you'll be it's much
easier to deal with the many the many
fires and pains that come with running a
business when you're getting a paycheck
every month and so um if a business is
not writing me a paycheck every month
then there is a problem
and a lot of us like to just think oh no
i'm reinvesting my business but you're
not reinvesting in your business you're
just not making any profit right i think
that's a much more important thing but
because we want to save our egos and we
want to posture and most important we're
just lying to ourselves that we're fee
we want to feel more successful because
we want to feel successful because we
feel so shitty all the time about
running the business so it's like at the
very least i can at least tell people
i'm successful so i feel better right
yeah but it's still not confronting the
brutal factual reality which is if
you're not making a profit there is a
problem and so for me that last story in
the book was a combination of years of
learning from failures of always selling
not caring about the margins much just
caring about growth wanting to quote
reinvest and put more money into new

87
01:26:00.000 --> 01:27:00.000
equipment and new locations and new
leases and new build outs and all that
kind of stuff when i would have been
much better served in my opinion
if i had just started if i had thought
how can i take this one location that i
had and then juice the crap out of it so
that it just pumps out profits for me
every single month rather than thinking
like oh i'm gonna do twice you know i'm
gonna do two of them or three of them or
four of them or whatever and so um for
me it was a pivotal moment because uh it
it finally came true i finally felt like
i had some money um and for me layla and
i were living on less than 30 000 a year
so for me that was like three and a half
years of of living expenses and so that
i was going to be okay and i think that
most of us have to get to that level
honestly like
i don't want to say as fast as you can
because if you think that way it it's
going to take longer
but
i can say that getting there i was able
to get my first level of what i would
consider security in place which is just
like food and shelter
um i felt like i was like okay and i'm
somebody who needs i personally have a

88
01:27:00.000 --> 01:28:00.000
need for lots of safety net i'm actually
fairly risk averse when it comes to the
money that i have
um so i like to know my wealth my
expense my income to expense ratio being
very very favorable like layla and i
lived on less than one percent of what
we made for the first two years wow um
yeah we lived on nothing we lived on
like i think a hundred and something
thousand a year but we were making 17
million so like we really didn't live
with much compared to what we were made
right
and i think that a lot of people get
they really want to posture like so
desperately want the status
and i think that if you can shift the
status at least to shifting it towards
your net worth that's useful
for most people and then if you can get
your spouse on board and get
play the game of how little can we live
on and if you can make it a fun game
where you win by living on almost
nothing
then you you inherently decrease the
stress in your life because you need so
little right and then by doing that you
also have less risk because when you
make decisions you're like well we can
live on a thousand bucks we know how to

89
01:28:00.000 --> 01:29:00.000
do that right and so it's always through
the back pocket whereas a lot of people
do the reverse of that they overspend
their income they they match their
living expenses to the best month that
they ever had which was a launch month
or something you know yeah and then the
rest of the time they're always stressed
and it was 100 self-induced and so i
think if we can avoid that then more
people will create the personal wealth
and then by you know subsequently the
emotional freedom that they're looking
for
incredible what a way to end the podcast
man
um
just a couple things alex uh davis
wanted to ask us is there any way that
we or the listeners out there can help
and support you
and then where we can reach you at um
where we can find you online
yeah
um i'll give you a a medium-sized answer
uh so uh youtube you can go to my
youtube channel if you like that it's
all free obviously um so you can go
check that out uh if you like listening
there's a podcast called the game you
can search my name it'll probably come
out um and i have the book that i just
uh released that um that chris was
referencing

90
01:29:00.000 --> 01:30:00.000
uh i mean in the first it's selling a
thousand copies a day right now um
with no ads and no funnels and no
upsells so i think that most people seem
to be liking it and telling people about
it um which is cool and i think part of
that is because of where the book came
from um which is kind of including the
very beginning of this conversation
which is this is the first business in
my opinion that i've created um
from a different place
right
we've made this because the goal is how
can i help as many entrepreneurs as i
possibly can
um and so the idea was kind of counter
what i'm saying in the book but the the
goal is different in this business so
the book uh is 99 cents it comes with
the course it comes with the downloads
it comes with the checklists and i'll
create a new book book 2 and 3 are
already done but i can't release them
because i just released this book like
five minutes ago so i'll release them in
time
but they'll each come with courses
that go with them um and that's just
because i believe that the education
system as a whole has failed all of us
and so i think that as as the education
system is increasingly fragmented um

91
01:30:00.000 --> 01:31:00.000
technology democratizes consumption and
consolidates production which means if
you're the best in the world you get to
do it for everyone and so my goal is to
help as many entrepreneurs as i can um
independent of what country they live in
what if whether they have no money that
whatever it is and then hopefully you
know
help some really cool amazing businesses
get started and then once they pass you
know 5 or 10 million bucks a year they
can reach out and we'd love to help them
get to the next level um and even if
they don't i'd love to die and just know
that we help a lot of people for free
and i don't think i'll regret that when
i'm when i'm eating
yeah
alex thank you so much for coming on the
show sharing all your tips and tricks
and wisdom with us and i think i speak
for everybody for helping ask uh and
answer some great questions
uh that the listeners came up with and
that we came from that came out of
reading your book man um
yeah so we'll keep you in contact
listeners we'll put the links in the
show notes again alex thank you so much
listeners we want to thank you for
tuning in once again and we'll see you
all on the next episode goodbye
everybody

92
01:31:00.000 --> 01:32:00.000
dude awesome podcast thank you so much
man i really appreciate it
awesome hopefully it's not bad
i think it's great
um when we go live do you want us do you
have a marketing person you would like
us to email or the person i was in touch
with maybe that was your assistant
okay all right sounds good and um yeah
anything else like things i can keep in
the back of my mind people you're
looking to get connected with we come
across some pretty amazing people you
know always help happy to to connect if
possible
yeah i mean if you if you find any
education and training companies um or
software companies there's the two
companies that i target um that are kind
of over that three to five million
dollar threshold 10 15 20 whatever
that's fine um but really
ideally over five unless it's a software
company that has some unique angle um
then uh then yeah they can send them our
way and maybe we can help them out and
maybe we can and if we can't we'll still
try and help them the best of our
ability mainly education and software um

93
01:32:00.000 --> 01:33:00.000
yeah i'll keep that in mind we have a
private community of uh like seven and
eight figure entrepreneurs and so
uh we do deal with those people on a
regular basis so media and code that's
what i'm looking for sorry to say that
again
media and code
is the base of your business you have
media as the base of your business
things i like zero cost of replication
awesome all right
okay buddy thanks so much for coming on
