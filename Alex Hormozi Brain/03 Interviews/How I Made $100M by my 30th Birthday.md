1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:00.000
they were like how do you achieve
youtube but like there's five years of
my life that disappeared in fact i lost
all the money which i talked about in
the book i had all the gyms i did the
turnarounds and then i had zero dollars
five years later because of mistakes
that i made
hey guys welcome back to another episode
today we're speaking with alex homozy
he's owner of quite a few different
companies he's generated over a hundred
million dollars by the time he was 30
and he's got a goal to become a
billionaire this guy's a super smart guy
and he's going to talk you through his
path and everything he's doing on how he
scales companies he's got many companies
from zero to two million dollars a month
in like a year it's insane so alex thank
you so much for taking the time to speak
with me today the first question we ask
everyone that comes on is how did you
get your job aka how did you find
yourself doing the work you're doing

2
00:01:00.000 --> 00:02:00.000
today
oh by a master plan i started out when i
was three um
i i okay i iterated and failed my way
here so i um went to school for a
business degree uh did management
consulting after school for two years
did um
defense contracting so space cyber
intelligence top secret all that stuff
sounded really cool sounds much cooler
than it was for me i was mostly just
taking notes during dictated meetings
and turning them into highlighted
color-coded notes um
but didn't like that uh had co-workers
tell me that i should start fitness
stuff because it was all i was talking
about
used the consulting method which i knew
which is look up experts and connect
with them because it's faster to learn
that way emailed 40 guys one guy got
back to me
i offered to work for him for free
i left everything i had sold my condo
drove across the country 36 hours later
i was there uh worked for free for three
months started my first facility um
learned about facebook ads at about that
time uh used that as the primary of

3
00:02:00.000 --> 00:03:00.000
getting customers
uh opened up a new location every six
months
after the
after month 15 of the first location
opened up a new location every six
months at full capacity um
went to a different marketing summit saw
a guy
signed up for his his like mentorship he
said i should be showing people
how i was doing what i was doing rather
than opening up more gyms i took his
advice because he was richer than me
so then i did turnarounds for uh so i
flew around the country and did uh 33
turnarounds so i flew out and filled
people's gyms and uh had an eight guy
sales team doing that turn around eight
gyms a month that was uh an intense
period
and then uh from there uh realized that
the logistics were getting really
difficult to scale we were doing
probably three three-ish hundred
thousand a month at that point
and so we switched to a licensing model
um
and uh and then that is when everything
kind of took off there's a ton of
heartbreak and bankruptcies and failed
partnerships intermixed in there but

4
00:03:00.000 --> 00:04:00.000
that is the two-minute story of how i
got to the first big successful company
which is gym launch then we started a
supplement company 12 months later uh
then we started a software company 12
months after that um and then we started
the parent company acquisition.com we
acquired interest in three other
companies about to be four so we'll have
seven in the portfolio um
and those companies now do about 85
million a year do you think
entrepreneurs
are hardwired or or do you think they
they can be made
and if so why
i think it's a really good question i
think it's a nature nurture thing so i
think that there are some people who are
hardcore could never live another way
and there are some people who will never
be entrepreneurs but i think there's a
whole lot of gray in between that
depends on stimuli and circumstance i
think for me i don't think i was
hardwired an entrepreneur i wasn't
slaying in lemonade
i think if if there was like 10 being
you know the gary vee who says he could
never be anything but an entrepreneur
and then a one is
you know an academic chair at a
department of mechanical engineering um

5
00:04:00.000 --> 00:05:00.000
i think i was actually closer to like a
three like i think i'm actually left of
middle in terms of not being necessarily
an entrepreneur personality type
the only reason that i think i even got
into this was because i so disliked the
career that i was on
that i
i just wanted kind of candidly i just
wanted the emotional pain to end and so
i just thought like i didn't even want
to be alive anymore and so
i just threw away all my goals around
money and just said i'm going to do
something that i love even if i don't
make anything i'll start a gym i like
fitness
but then i got the bug and realized i
liked business more than i liked fitness
and then that kind of started the next
kind of passion that started growing
within me like the day that i opened my
gym was the day that fitness became
second
most important thing in my life business
became the most important thing in my
life
i see so
you wrote this book called hundred
million dollar offers yeah seems like
like a lot of like it seems like it's
doing really really well like what
compelled you to write this and what

6
00:05:00.000 --> 00:06:00.000
inspired you to write this book i know i
i i share my numbers really
transparently on the channel um you know
my wife and i have taken
a tremendous amount of dividends from
the business and we've sold you know one
um i sold my gyms but that wasn't
anything huge um and i we we signed our
will to give away everything we have
when we die anyways
so
i realized you know in thinking through
that decision i was like well
giving away everything that i have when
i die is is neat i guess uh because then
it decreases some of the pressure around
like why i make more now right um but
then i was like i think the most
valuable thing that i can give
isn't money
um which we do give but
it's it's the skills right it's the
giving fish versus teaching him into
fish and so
that was kind of the the spirit behind
the youtube channel the spirit behind
the books and the courses and things
that i'm just giving away now um mostly
because it feels good
[Laughter]
um and and because i i get to

7
00:06:00.000 --> 00:07:00.000
participate in some cool companies you
know some you know i get to meet new
people uh from this and i think that
layla and i were really really sheltered
in terms of how we've done our business
career at this point i mean you know we
were known within a very small niche but
for the most part we've just kind of
stuck to doing that that was actually an
active decision um
about a year into gym lunch once we
transitioned to licensing we were doing
about two and a half million a month and
we said we can't mess this up
and we've got too many families too many
employees who rely on us and so we
basically said we're not going to have
friends we're not going to drink we're
not going to go out we're just going to
work and right or wrong you know what i
mean that was just where i was mentally
at the time i was like i just need to do
this and do a really good job and we did
but now that we've kind of come i would
say come out of that season of life
now it's like hey we can look around and
share some of the lessons that we've
learned along the way yeah that's cool i
respect that so
um i have to ask you and just delve a
little deeper on that piece that
you said you you guys are you and your
partner they have already written your
will and you give everything away like
like why why

8
00:07:00.000 --> 00:08:00.000
we're not big believers in legacy you
know i believe at least you know america
is built on equal opportunity i don't
think that inherited wealth does anyone
any good
um
i think it's i think it ruins people i
think you have to learn how to like i
believe money is a um is a tool
and my favorite magic card which there's
a game called match of the gathering i
played was a kid but it was um she
wished for a weapon but not the skill to
wield it and so i think that people get
this very powerful tool and they don't
have the skill to wield it i think the
only way to have not have money on you
is to know how to generate it and then
you can respect it for what it is know
what its limitations are and know what
you can do it use it for and i think
that most people who are gifted it so if
i don't have kids but if i did have kids
i still wouldn't give them uh the money
and because they have to they have to do
it on their own otherwise it'll i think
it'll ruin them and when it comes to
aspirations um
one of my close friends
he's uh he's a gym guy um so i think he
yeah he's been following you for a long
time

9
00:08:00.000 --> 00:09:00.000
he mentioned to me that your aspirations
are to become a billionaire right so
like you you want to you still want to
acquire
um you know a sizable amount of wealth
right yes and it's
it's it's the easiest way for me
explained is like i want to have a very
big goal that sounds exciting um but i
have absolutely no emotional investment
if i never hit it i wouldn't be upset i
do think i'm going to get it but i but i
wouldn't be upset either way can you
talk to us about the how like
conceptually kind of like top level like
like how do you plan to get there we're
just going to be investing in businesses
that are similar the ones that we scaled
um and participate in the growth it's
very simple model
and just you know penciling out the
numbers like i know that i can acquire
probably a decent sized chunk of four to
eight businesses a year
and i think that i can reasonably
three to five x those in three years
because we're just looking at uh niche
businesses that we know that we can
crush so the thesis i'll i'll zoom out
for a second so the thesis point

10
00:09:00.000 --> 00:10:00.000
acquisition.com is that formal education
at least you know in america for me i
feel like formal education failed most
of us right you know we we put a lot of
money in there's some in the u.s you
can't bankrupt out of the debt like you
cannot get out of the debt that you owe
for your schooling
and the entire idea the original premise
of higher education was that you'd now
be a more valuable member to society to
be able to be more gainfully employed
and provide value right the problem is
that the promise is undelivered right
and people go in and get the same level
of income after they get a degree as as
what they could get before and if you
just look at the parallel track of
somebody who took the same amount of
money and spent it on what i would
consider alternative education over a
four year period
i would say almost invariably the person
who spends an alternative education
would be far better off four years later
than somebody who partied for four years
at college
and so i think that with technology
i borrow this from naval ravicon i just
like the quote a lot of technology
democratizes consumption and
consolidates production which means if
you're the best in the world you get to
do it for everyone and so i think that
education is going to become or already

11
00:10:00.000 --> 00:11:00.000
has been and will increase in its
fragmentation so you'll have more
niche verticals and instead of having
generalists which is what formal
education is based on liberal arts where
you get like
english and math and aztec literature
and female studies and whatever right um
instead it's how to use aaron b to make
money
how to drive uber and make money how to
use you know to amazon fba what's
hilarious to me is that like there's
more amazon sellers than there are
almost then you can pick you can pick a
profession that's out there in the
united states and there are more
individual amazon sellers than there are
almost of any you know sub
subgroup of individual thing but why
isn't amazon or e-commerce a a major in
undergraduate it's a real you know it's
a real way of making money and so i
think that with this huge fragmentation
education hasn't hasn't gotten close to
catching up but the demand for high
value skills has never been higher and
so you have this huge amount of demand
for people who want to have skills so
they can feed themselves and provide
value and then you have almost no supply
and so what that's given birth to is
what i would consider you know the
alternative education scene which is

12
00:11:00.000 --> 00:12:00.000
blowing up right the entire all the
gurus and e-learning and all that stuff
and some of it's bad some of it's good
but at the end of the day the demand is
going to drive it and so um my bet that
in my thesisfind acquisition.com is i
want to find the people who are the best
at their specific thing the best salon
girl the best autumn you know auto
mechanic the best gym owner the best all
of these things and then wrap the model
that i already know how to deliver
you know provide exceptional service
provide great value how to teach
effectively so that people can
understand the concepts and then
ultimately make a lot of profit and then
uh participate in that process so that's
that's the thesis behind it yeah
fascinating um
we share similar views on
education
and that whole system um
won't go too deep because could talk
about it forever um you talk about the
you know the billionaire goal um
like what once you hit that like what's
next and and how and and when do you
want to do that buy i think if i said it
it would it would sound unreasonable but

13
00:12:00.000 --> 00:13:00.000
i think that i mean i'll tell you what i
have in my head i don't think i've said
it publicly but um
i think 10 years is what i is what i
think i can i mean it'd be cool to do it
sooner than that and that's barring you
know a global meltdown and reset or
whatever
like an erasing of currencies and crypto
ruling the world but you know short of
that happening and as long as you know
the whatever the
the recession that is coming comes in is
just a normal level recession and not
like a global depression meltdown um i
think that in 10 years we could get
there and that's just based on normal
like just based on the assets that we
already have how i plan on allocating
the assets and what kinds of returns i
think we'll be able to reasonably expect
um
that's where that's that's based out of
because all i have to really do is get
to
100 million in ebitda
um
in 10 years
and then the company you know the
portfolio i have will be worth a billion
so
that i mean that's that's what i have to
do so i feel like i can do that though
i'm curious as well kind of like what
would be next once you hit that so

14
00:13:00.000 --> 00:14:00.000
what would be next
is just continuing
alex's boring recipe for success let's
just keep doing what's working um i
would just continue to do that but
i think that what'll be different with
acquisition.com the way in the designing
it is i'm i'm trying to design it so
that everybody
every single party that touches it
benefits
so the vast majority of the like because
there's a it's like an ecosystem of what
i'm trying to build so
everybody who consumes all the content
for free
right gets hopefully
value foreign access to the time that
they're investing because that is the
real cost it's the time that you're
investing and consuming the content
right and so if you get value for an
excess of that then you will be left
better off and that's going to be 99.9
of people because i'm not selling
anything
for the 0.1 or 0.01 percent of companies
that we may end up you know partnering
with or doing some sort of investment
deal with
those companies will benefit because
we'll be able to directly invest in them
and we'll help them help them grow
the team that i have within
acquisition.com i'm recruiting the
absolute best in the world so we're

15
00:14:00.000 --> 00:15:00.000
talking about people who have uncapped
earning potential so they can make five
hundred thousand a million two million
dollars a year five million dollars a
year um within that structure so the
people who work for me will be able to
make you know tremendous amounts of
income and create their own own
independent wealth and then obviously
acquisition.com as a portfolio itself um
has to make money and then maybe in the
future i'll be able to help all of those
companies you know all those people they
could reinvest uh their own money and
then also participate as both an
investor and a and a doer um and so
that's what i'm trying to create is just
a huge ecosystem that just creates value
for all parties that are involved
yeah i love it so
um
we i want to dive into your framework
more but i have to ask one question
selfishly it's not it's not written down
here like dude if you want to become a
billionaire wouldn't the fastest way
from from my perspective and this comes
from
i've interviewed a lot of billionaires
spoken to a lot of like extraordinarily
successful people probably

16
00:15:00.000 --> 00:16:00.000
hundreds at this point
um
there is no doubt about it that the
fastest way from my perspective to
acquire and generate serious amounts of
personal wealth is starting a software
company and getting it to 100 million
arr
um
why don't you do that like you're a
super smart guy why wouldn't you just
focus on that it's a really good
question it's it's what i mean my wife
and i talk about all the time because i
i say the same i mean we we go back and
forth on this thing
um
i think the biggest thing is
i'll walk you through the
decision-making process or at least the
reasoning behind it so
i think that software if you look at the
people who are billionaires right
many of them create it through software
now right
and so
what i feel like is not represented as
the many people who tried to create it
with software and failed
and so if we're looking at the ones who
become billionaires
it's like vc if i bet on 50

17
00:16:00.000 --> 00:17:00.000
one of them or two of them are going to
hit it right but if you're the
entrepreneur in the one your success
likelihood is far lower whereas i feel
like if i invest the way that i plan on
investing i will have a vehicle that
compounds capital at a very high rate of
return
um and i can diversify my risk and and
virtually guarantee that i get there and
so that's the it's it's a risk analysis
which is i could probably hit bigger but
the risk that i don't hit it
um is is high
it's reasonable at least whereas the
risk that i don't hit it on the other
side i feel like is is dramatically
lower
and i still have software companies that
are coming to me that i can still
participate in that process so that's
that's the that's the overarching
reasoning behind it now that being said
maybe in three years we'll get on here
and i'll be like you know what man i was
full of i saw the software
opportunity and i crushed it so maybe
that's but where i currently stand um
and i think part of that's because my
heroes are like charlie munger and
warren buffett like those guys are my

18
00:17:00.000 --> 00:18:00.000
absolute
heroes in terms of how they live their
lives and how they make decisions and
how they think through things and so
that's
i think that's been a big influence on
why i'm i'm choosing to go in this
direction yeah that makes sense so
you're going like the portfolio model
look to be honest it's probably more fun
that way too let's be honest that was a
big part of it because layla and i spent
18 months figuring out what do we want
to do
what do we really want to do is the next
thing the next season for us
and um and i had all these like
non-negotiables right i was like i don't
know if i want to run another one um end
to end i mean i can do it i just i don't
know if i want to do another you know
grind first three years again um
maybe but i don't know um
what's something that i won't get bored
of because for me i get bored in about
24 months that's my
that's my window i know that and so
if i can participate in lots of
different companies i think that i will
be able to keep my attention on one
thing
um and i think that's probably the
biggest
it's probably the biggest one
because like every company we've started
has gone from zero to two million a

19
00:18:00.000 --> 00:19:00.000
month in less than a year like every
company so we know how to scale them i
just
i you know what i'm saying
so you talk about crafting an offer
that's so good that people feel stupid
saying no
um so why is the offer the most
important part when it comes to selling
anything
or build building a business in general
i struggle with saying it's the most
important because you and i both know
it's
it's like an engine right like a
business is like an engine you need
wheels as much as you need cylinders as
much as you need gas all of them are
important right
um but i see the offer is like the spark
but we're actually giving them exchange
for their money and i think most
entrepreneurs who are starting out do it
out of sequence and so they try and fix
step two or step three and they're like
hey why is my copy bad or why are my ads
not performing when they're not starting
with the very first part of the process
which is that that initial transaction
right and so
a lot of my learnings around the offer
came out of necessity because i prefer

20
00:19:00.000 --> 00:20:00.000
to be dealing with tremendous demand and
fixing operational problems um rather
than trying to generate demand
and so
my my belief is like the the three piece
of scaling that i adhere to is zero to a
million is promotion one to ten million
is product
ten to a hundred is people right and you
can say well if you have the right
people you could yeah but that's not
typically how it actually happens right
so you have to know enough promotion
because if you have nothing then you
need to get people to find out right so
you have to start generating some
traction
once you get the traction and this is
where i think people mess up is they
they get their first dollar from
promoting and then think i need to spend
more dollars promoting when it's like
that is the the whole point here is to
get the product market fit and make sure
that the product is exceptional and
we're getting virality from it people
are sharing it we're getting amazing
reviews all of that stuff is happening
because then when we go back to really
scaling we're going to get so much more
return on every dollar of advertising or
media that we're buying that it all
makes the whole machine work whereas
most people then try and dump more

21
00:20:00.000 --> 00:21:00.000
promotion on top of it but the product
isn't fixed
and so the reason that the offer was so
important was because just getting that
first traction that first spark started
it's so much easier to just give someone
everything they possibly could dream of
and then work backwards from there i'm
curious kind of you said also that you
know the past few companies that you've
worked with you've taken from zero to
two million a month in a year is that
correct yeah so prestige launched 1.7
million a month uh by month i think like
four
uh
jim launch hit two million a month
within 12 months of us hitting uh
switching to licensing and then alan was
at 1.7 as well so just under two yeah
wow okay
so
multiple different industries which was
the steepest learning curve
software
why i see business like there's three
pieces where you've got acquisition
you've got product and you've got ops
right shared services whatever you want
to call it right
so with the first two companies so with

22
00:21:00.000 --> 00:22:00.000
with uh jim launch the gym licensing
company acquisition i could cover
product i could cover because i knew
everything about because what i was
showing was how to acquire customers
just within a smaller niche right um and
run the business model and all the other
things so i had i understood both the
acquisition and the delivery to a to an
immense amount of detail right i knew i
was a
i would say i was a master at it i'd
masters level both of these things and
then my wife
is a is a prodigious operator like she
can build a team around anything which
is why we've been able to scale so many
things so quickly
so with the first company all three
pieces were in place it blew up the
second company i contracted uh the best
doctor that i'm aware of
um to create all the formulas for all
the products that we sold and so i had
the acquisition i had the product and
then we had the the operational piece
again with my wife
with software
i knew how to acquire the customers we
knew how to build the team but i'm not a
code guy and the mistake that i made

23
00:22:00.000 --> 00:23:00.000
when i was building allen was that i did
not have a
technical co-founder which is what i
should have had and so i had an
outsourced development team and that was
a big mistake
i shouldn't have done that and i just
didn't and the thing is is it's so
difficult
you know i was i was blind negotiating
is how i'd say it's like
you i would say hey can we change this
button right and then you'd say
you know it takes a month and i'd be
like
i feel like you can do better than that
i had no idea it could have taken two
years i have no clue so i'm blind
negotiating
trying to just keep a front but i have
no clue what i'm talking about and i
hate operating from some sort of that
kind of information disadvantage and so
that was the that was why it was so
difficult
now i blew the doors off for the
acquisition because i can go market and
sell all day long
um but with software to your point
getting you know 100 million arr to get
the 10x multiple that you're going to
get on it it's about having that
negative churn and that's going to be
all product driven right that's going to
be making sure that the ux is amazing

24
00:23:00.000 --> 00:24:00.000
the engineering team's on point you know
like people are promoting like crazy all
that kind of stuff and so i feel like
it's interesting because in the internet
marketing world um because i see this
all over the place so many of these guys
are switching to trying to do software
but they're selling the software the
same way they sell their digital
products which means they have a
software and they're just selling it and
then everyone's leaving and they're like
i'm gonna be able to sell this for a ton
of money it's like no you're not
you're only gonna be able to sell for a
ton of money if if you didn't market it
still grows
so can you tell me also about kind of um
the tiny market big money process
like how are you finding niche markets
that are overflowing with cash i would
say they're not necessarily overflowing
with cash but i think if we can apply
a standardized framework to how we
approach their business
um
we it sounds silly but like you can plug
into the universe
the universe's money and then you can
have as much money of it as you want so
for example let's say i was i was
working with you know hairstylists
typically not what most people would

25
00:24:00.000 --> 00:25:00.000
consider a very affluent you know
demographic now there's plenty of them
and it's definitely a niche
but they're not considered i would say
you know super wealthy
but
if i know how to market and sell and and
deliver high value services and i show
them how to do that and they can
immediately generate let's say five
thousand ten thousand dollars
using a system that i've you know put
together for them so they can run their
business model
i don't need them to have money i need
my system to work and then have the
system make them enough money to pay me
and that's the key point like
with with any of these things is like
i've never operated on how much money
someone has i operate on how much money
i can make them
[Music]
and then i siphon off of that
and so i'm going to dive a little bit
tactical on this but i think it would be
valuable to the audience so there's a
there's a process that we have followed
um in every company that i've ever built
um and this process will be in the third
book which is called money models um
but it's it's called client finance

26
00:25:00.000 --> 00:26:00.000
acquisition or at least that's what i
call it and so client finance
acquisition is when you have essentially
a negative acquisition cost and the
equation for that is for me that i must
make in 30 day cash right which is
something that i call but just the
amount of cash that i can take from a
customer in net free cash flow in the
first 30 days and the first 30 days is
important which i'll and i'll get back
to why it's important a second but the
amount of money that i can generate from
a new customer in the first 30 days in
net free cash flow must exceed two times
the cost of acquisition and the cost of
fulfillment
if i can do that
then it means that i no longer am
capital constrained for growth and so i
can use the cash so let's say i acquire
let's say it cost me a hundred bucks to
a car customer right and let's say it
cost me
i don't know 100 bucks to fulfill them
all right so 200 is is my cost i have to
make
two times that in
net free cash
so i would have to price i would have to
be selling whatever the widget is i'd
have to generate 600

27
00:26:00.000 --> 00:27:00.000
in cash in the first 30 days from that
prospect if i can do that i cover their
cost of fulfillment and their cost of
acquisition and the cost of acquiring
and fulfilling the next customer off of
that initial
and i still have money left over to then
profit hire more people etc and so that
is what we try to design an acquisition
system that we build independent of
market whether it's for photographers
whether it's for certifications whether
it's for gym licensing whether it's for
e-commerce we do it in every single
vertical we're in and we continue to
push the model until we achieve that and
then at that point we no longer have a
marketing budget we can spend as much
money as we damn well please in the
acquisition and then operations becomes
the bottleneck of scale
and so that is why each of the companies
has scaled at such a rapid rate is
because i don't need anyone's money to
do it and why we've owned every one of
the companies outright without taking on
outside capital you've talked around
100xing your prices
and

28
00:27:00.000 --> 00:28:00.000
uh
yeah like actually acquiring more
clients
like how did you pull that off
by making them an offer so good they
felt stupid saying now um
the uh so i i give the classic dan
kennedy example which i like a lot which
is let's say that we had a time
management course right generic time
management course you sell for 19 bucks
you're not going to be able to sell for
really much more than that
if i drilled down down a little bit and
made it a sales time management course i
might be able to sell that for 99
if i niche down even further and said
outbound sales are sales reps i might be
able to sell that for 500
if i dish down even further i might say
um you know automotive outbound sales
reps
i might be able to sell that same course
for two thousand dollars and so the
difference between the 19 thing and the
two and the two thousand dollar thing is
a hundred x difference in price and
we're able to achieve that because the
avatar that we're selling it to we can
clearly demonstrate how much one
additional sale could mean for them in
their paycheck over the year or maybe
one more sale per month and then

29
00:28:00.000 --> 00:29:00.000
dramatically show the discrepancy what
they're paying and what they're getting
right and so i feel like it is
it is
unless you are well funded and well
capitalized and trying to go after like
a market penetration strategy which the
vast majority of entrepreneurs who are
bootstrapped etc do not have that
situation
then they have to go in my opinion in
the other direction and say how can i
very specifically find an avatar that i
will have a competitive advantage
because i will understand their needs
wants desires problems etc and i can in
a very real way provide more value than
anyone else can because i am so nuanced
in who i serve
and then with that niche down messaging
positioning problem solving etc i then
generate outsized profits
which then allows me to spin the
acquisition machine so i can get more
customers i can spend more money to to
get higher quality talent provide a
better experience etc
look if there's one thing that you
wanted people to walk away from
kind of everything you're doing on the
education piece the the knowledge

30
00:29:00.000 --> 00:30:00.000
sharing the books what what would that
be
give more
and
i'll pause for a second and and explain
that so i think that the one thing that
i think garyvee says this well he says
you know listen to what i'm saying but
watch what i'm doing right and i think
that most people could learn more about
watching the entrepreneurs what moves
they're making rather than necessarily
even what they're saying
um and part of that's because i think
you know you don't always you're not
always consciously aware of the moves
you're making right you just you only
remember to say x y and z but there's
more nuance to it and so
the thing is is i think that goodwill
compounds faster than revenue does
and so
i believe that if you truly give
tremendous value and tremendous being
the operative word here i think most
people are like dude my content's so
good it's like yeah but no one watches
it and if it were so good
you'd have more people watching it right
um
if you give a tremendous amount of value
better than what everyone else's paid
stuff is and that's and that has to be

31
00:30:00.000 --> 00:31:00.000
real though right like that has to be
real people say that but it's not true
and that's the hard part is that the
self-awareness piece of like my stuff's
so good but it probably isn't which is
why you're not making the money well
you're not as good as you think you are
but if you actually can deliver truly
more than anyone else can and you can
price it at zero
the amount of goodwill that you get
becomes viral and then at that point you
will have more demand than you know what
to do with and then at that point you'll
have this desire to liquidate the demand
the goodwill and monetize it but that's
what you should resist doing
and instead double down on giving more
and only only skimming off a handful
that you can service at a high level
and by doing that you never have to keep
generating demand you will always have
more demand than you want and that
demand will continue to multiply and i
talk about this in the book in the
delicate dance of desire right which is
like if we can just service the absolute
best customers the best avatars who
perfectly fit
the problems that we know how to solve
better than anyone else everyone else
gets value from you in the marketplace

32
00:31:00.000 --> 00:32:00.000
and the people that you specifically
select be your customers will get
outsized returns they'll rave about you
more people will demand what you want
and again you sell less than your
ability to sell
and i think that's the dance that most
people mess up and so if i had to
consolidate it into two words let's give
more
and if you give more than you take the
marketplace will always reward you but
most people their messaging is just you
know give take
give take
give take whereas rather than like the
true like give give give
and my opinion is give give give give
keep going and eventually you just start
getting you don't even have to ask you
just start getting
that's just something that i have lived
through um
and i think that if that became real for
more people
more people would become zillionaires
but it requires the the big p word which
is patience and most people don't have
so
man i love that um i think that's really
really smart um yeah that's awesome so

33
00:32:00.000 --> 00:33:00.000
i'm curious as well i want to talk about
mindset um
not sexy
uh often
often kind of overlooked but you know
you you've had serious success for
someone your age um
i'm curious kind of
like what what gives you the ability to
go out and kind of
sell and do what you do and not even
just selling but like even the way that
you speak like you really command a lot
of confidence um
what what how do you acquire that were
you always this way or
yes and no
um i think we have natural proclivities
and i think everybody's you know
we have natural tendencies that we're
better at than other things just from
our upbringing whatever
um but i've thought a lot about this and
i think that there's
there's three pieces to it there's
skills beliefs and character traits and
hopefully it's not repetitive for you
because you've probably heard me say
this but like i see the ladder of
success as having three sides you have

34
00:33:00.000 --> 00:34:00.000
both poles and you've got the middle the
middle handles that you need to climb up
i think that a lot of times
entrepreneurs are lopsided they'll have
let's say there's their skills might be
you know up to the 10th 10th story of
the building they're um their their
traits might be to the sixth sixth floor
of the left pole
but the handles their beliefs might be
to the third and then they're curious
and why they can't get past the third
pole and then they keep growing their
skills from the sixth this is their
traits from the sixth the seventh or
their their skills from the 10th to the
11th but they can't get past the third
thing it's because they don't
adequately understand what their
limitation is
and so i think that's the like having
that level of discernment and awareness
of figuring out what my true
bottleneck is because people solve
problems that aren't that that aren't
problems their circumstances right and
so they they put all this energy and
effort to thinking like i need to get
another copywriting course but
copywriting's not the weak link in the
chain and so they keep fortifying a
piece of the bridge
but there's a part that has a brick
missing and they can't get the dollar
across the bridge but the side on the
right has 17 pillars holding it up to

35
00:34:00.000 --> 00:35:00.000
hold up all this traffic that's not
coming because they're missing something
very simple and i think that's the
i think that's the piece but in terms of
the command and the confidence um i
don't think that there's actually a hack
to this and so i feel pretty passionate
about this
so we've we've used the term because i
had somebody in a live audience ask me
this and something came out of my mouth
and people kept repeating it which is
you have to outwork yourself down
and so
when we talk about sales processes or if
i talk about monetization structures i
talk about you know creating offers
right we're like you said i only give so
much confidence and conviction in this
it's because i've done it so many
 times right and so when people
were asking me like and i'm gonna i'm
gonna really drive this because i think
it's important
so when we started the gym business
right and this is just because so many
people are learning from people in the
e-learning space and i think it's good
to have a lens to which to make
decisions right of how how much am i
going to weight this person's opinion
right
so i had

36
00:35:00.000 --> 00:36:00.000
one gym and it was successful and then i
had a second gym and after i had my
second gym i didn't start selling how to
make a gym successful i had a third gym
and then i had a fourth gym and then i
had a fifth gym and then i had a sixth
gym right and then at that point
i didn't sell a course on how to make
him successful then i spent a year and a
half flying out because i had an offer
that no one could say no to which was
don't pay me anything i'll generate 100
of the sales i'll risk my own money fly
out there and do it myself and i did 33
turnarounds
so 33 different markets sat at the front
desk for three and a half weeks and sold
memberships all day long
at 4 000 sales face-to-face
under my belt
before we started gym launch
and so i think what happens is what i
was talking about that goodwill thing is
like people are so
so impatient to jump to the next level
of the pyramid that they don't build the
foundation and i it's my belief that the
peak of the pyramid is predicated on the
base on the thickness and the width of
the foundation that you build and that's

37
00:36:00.000 --> 00:37:00.000
the rocky cutscene that most people are
not willing to go through
like you were like how have you achieved
youtube like there's five years of my
life that disappeared in fact i lost all
the money which i talk about in the book
i had all the gyms i did the turnarounds
and then i had zero dollars
five years later because of mistakes
that i made but the things that i was
gaining was not the money it was the
skills it was the character traits and
the beliefs and those were the assets
that i was able to take with me and then
the next thing because all i had because
i had the traits and i had the skills i
had already run a huge sales team i was
already used to doing 20 30 50 sales a
day
face to face like i knew how to do a
high volume sales a him i knew how to
market i knew how to write copy i knew
how to buy media like i knew all this
stuff i knew how to deliver on the thing
but the thing that i was lacking was the
belief in terms of the opportunity
vehicle that i need to wrap those skills
in
and once i had an outside person who
came in and said hey i think you should
use this vehicle instead of this vehicle
that's when everything took off for me
but people see that overnight success

38
00:37:00.000 --> 00:38:00.000
but it was because of the foundation of
both sides of that of that ladder that
were built and i was just missing three
or four of these pegs and all of a
sudden i was able to sprang up from
three million dollars a year to 30
million dollars a year in 12 months
but it's because all those things were
in place
sorry i know that was i just wanted to
hit back on the other one about
confidence it's like most people are
looking for a hack when the reality is
that you're just not as good
you're just not that good
and the way to be confident is to do it
more times to do it so many times that
it's obvious to you that it is boring to
you once it gets boring is when people
will you'll sound like you're confident
but to you it'll be a matter of fact
because that is just how it is because
you've observed it in reality not in
theory so many times the problem is most
of the guys who are saying this stuff
are only saying it because they heard
someone else say in the regurgitating
theory but they never experienced it and
that's the kind of grit people can hear
last question is
just kind of like biggest mistakes
common mistakes you see people make

39
00:38:00.000 --> 00:39:00.000
especially early stage entrepreneurs
startup founders um what what are those
what's like the biggest mistake you see
entrepreneurs making in 2021 it's rush
the biggest mistake
i mean i always like seven an 18 now
he's 19 year old neighbor and he kept
trying to make up he's trying to be a
millionaire right every month he was
trying to be a millionaire with a new
thing
i was like if you could sign a contract
with me and i said i could guarantee
that you'll be a millionaire in 10 years
but you're not going to make anything
between now and then when you sign it
he said yeah i'd sign it and i was like
cool this is your note this is this is
your employment agreement now you're
working for me and you're gonna start
cold calling
and so he started cold calling
and he started his way now he's like you
know he's he's one of the top closes on
our team he's worked his way up three
rungs of the ladder in our sales teams
and now he's 19 years old making 150
grand a year right
um because he's he's taking everything
to heart he's got hustle
but
this is just the beginning of his
journey there's lots of other skills
along that i'm going to start putting
and putting into place so that when he
has done that instead of having a
four-year degree where he's going to

40
00:39:00.000 --> 00:40:00.000
learn how to chug beer
right
four years from now he's going to have
500 000 saved up
and he's going to have all the skills so
he can start his his next thing the
right way with experience inside of a
business knowing what it's supposed to
be
and so the biggest mistake that they
make is that they're such a rush that
they try a new thing every 90 days and
my fear is that they're going to be so
many guys who've been trying to make it
big in 90 day sprints on the next new
thing that 10 years from now they think
they're 90 days away
when if they just stuck with the same
thing for 10 years it would be
unreasonable for them not to be
exceptional because no one has
stick-to-it-ness and if you stick with
it even if you suck you'll be better
than most people after a year
and after 10 years you'll be almost
untouchable because no one sticks with
any
man that was an epic story so so you got
an apprentice he actually signed the
contract yeah he started working with us
wow that's cool he was trying to
wholesale real estate and i walked in on
him because he got some course or
whatever on the internet and he was like
i was i would always i was like how many

41
00:40:00.000 --> 00:41:00.000
deals you got how many deals you got it
was always zero i was having any deals i
had many deals yet and then i um
i walked in on him while he was trying
to close the deal once and he hung up
and i was like dude it's like i know
you're having closing deals he's like
what i was like you suck at sales
and he was like
oh
anything he like paused for saying he's
like how do i get good at sales and i
was like
you sell
and i was like so you know you can try
and do it on your own i was like or i
can just feed you volume all day
and you can get you know 100 reps a day
every single day and you're gonna you
can massively condense that that
learning period he was like well i'll do
that i was like and you can get paid
instead of paying money to do it it was
like well i guess i'll do that so
yeah there you go
awesome well look um
we're going to move to rapid fire
questions i've got three questions for
you age old question does money make you
happy
yes or no explain your answer
yes
in that it provides you the time to have

42
00:41:00.000 --> 00:42:00.000
the thoughts so i think it opens the
door to give you the potential to answer
life's harder questions but if you are
stuck in scarcity and survival you can
never get to that or it's very difficult
i'll say to get to that level not think
it's impossible it's just difficult
where do you see yourself 10 years from
now
what's the big picture beyond the money
it's it's the it's the scale of the
learning so for me part of the reason
that i want to build acquisition.com to
expand a little bit on it is because i
don't i don't know anybody who's like a
specialist in this space at taking
companies from like three or five to
fifty to a hundred
and i was like man we've done it three
times on our own and we've got a fourth
one under our belt in the portfolio
company and i'm like i'll bet you if i
did it a hundred times i would be able
to write the sickest book about it
and then that that piece of knowledge
would be public domain and more
companies could do it so i would just
see that as like me laying one brick
you know on the path for you know the
next season of entrepreneurs yeah that's

43
00:42:00.000 --> 00:43:00.000
awesome
um last one if you could have dinner
with any entrepreneur dead or alive who
would it be and why
it's a hard call for me
i really like charlie and warren but i
feel like i know what they'd say
um
elon
is just so brilliant i'm not sure if i
would catch everything he was saying
jeff is really brilliant but i feel like
i can i feel like i could communicate
with him
um
and i'll tell you what i would ask him
um i would say if you look at my skills
my character traits and my viewpoints of
the world and you were in my shoes
what opportunities would you pursue
because he has a better vantage point
than me so you can see what i can't see
yeah love it man look this was an
awesome interview we'll wrap there but
