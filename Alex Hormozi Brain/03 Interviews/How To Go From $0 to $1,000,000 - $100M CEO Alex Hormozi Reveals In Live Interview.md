00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and when i went through your book was you 
know on you know changing the cheese on you  
know people having to move from one niche to 
the other because they feel that i'm not able  
to get clients in this niche and so maybe i should 
just switch my niche and i'll get clients and how  
exactly does that not solve the problem of coin 
client acquisition you know so so fundamentally  
as long as you are not selling newspapers which is 
what i give is the example in the book as long as  
you're not truly selling ice to eskimos as long as 
you're you're selling something that people want  
which a lot of times is the problem right um as 
long as you're selling something people want if  
you're if you're a marketer for example and you're 
trying to sell uh you know getting more leads or  
making more sales everyone wants that right so 
that's there's there's really no disconnect there  
the issue is usually that you have a 
lack of skill in some way and the problem  
that that rises is when you start trying to switch 
avatars or switch niches uh you end up having to  
start over again because you have to learn the 
avatar you have to learn the desires you have  
to learn how to speak to them you have to learn 
what their problems are and the thing that i that  

2
00:01:00.000 --> 00:02:00.000
i kind of go with is that all of those will work 
but none of them will work if you try to make them  
all work right so you have to you have to grow 
through elimination right because i'm a big a big  
believer in the theory of constraint we'll grow 
to the constraint that we have and most people  
and this is a this is one that maybe everyone in 
the audience can replicate or can resonate with  
when i see an entrepreneur who's doing a million 
or five million or 10 million or whatever and they  
say well i'm going to start this other vertical 
i'm going to start this other thing what ends up  
happening is that this one goes up and their main 
one goes down and they're still doing 10 million  
dollars except they have more overhead now and so 
um it's you can't be ceo of two companies right  
like think about how many how many publicly 
traded ceos exist that are ceos of two companies  
there's only one person that anyone ever gives 
and they say elon musk but he's he's actually not  
he's not the operator he's the owner founder of 
those companies and he has people who run them but  
the point is is that you're probably not elon musk 
um if you're still struggling to make your first  
sales so if that's the situation then let's just 
cross them off the equation and say that no one  

3
00:02:00.000 --> 00:03:00.000
is doing ceo of multiple companies and so the 
issue is a lot of times with the definitions  
right so it's like i'm owner but so you hire one 
person because you're one person you figure oh  
well i'm one person i'll hire one person and 
there we go and i'll have a passive business  
but the reality is that there's so many 
shades of what we do because we're really  
just fractionally doing like eight different 
jobs right so you're you're head of customer  
service your head your vp of sales your your chief 
marketing officer your ceo you're also owner right  
and you're so you're doing all of these roles 
and so you maybe replace the fulfillment  
but you still have to be cmo you have to be still 
vp of sales you still have to be the owner you  
have to be all these are their hats and 
so if you're trying to imagine doing that  
for two businesses or three businesses it becomes 
it becomes a work equation that doesn't work and  
people can't solve it right and that's why they 
they burn out and give up because they're spread  
too thin there's not enough heat for the amount of 
pans on the stove and so the the formula in case  
anyone's listening i'm not sure how how developed 
the audience is but for zero to a million which is  
most people are starting out right it's just 
it's one one one all right it's one product to  

4
00:03:00.000 --> 00:04:00.000
one avatar on one channel and if you're like well 
i'll do one product one avatar one channel on each  
of my businesses no no it's one product to one 
avatar on one channel and you will fail and you  
will continue to fail until you succeed and then 
at that point it will begin to work and most of  
the time in my opinion the reason i started all 
the the series of books with the offer is that  
getting customers shouldn't be difficult 
the difficulty should be in the fulfillment  
which means being good at your craft all right 
because what happens a lot of times is people  
think they need to learn more promotion 
more sales and that's true to a degree  
right but it's in my opinion easier to just make 
a more compelling offer do more for your clients  
even if you only have a handful of them that is 
not scalable and that's okay because you need to  
generate cash flow and make sales learn as much as 
you can get better at your craft and then in time  
create a more scalable offer as you learn what 
they value what they don't value what takes  
you time what doesn't take you time and as you 
ultimately get better right and so that's kind  

5
00:04:00.000 --> 00:05:00.000
of like the tesla model too it's like you start 
with the the most expensive thing at the top you  
start there and then as you build that and you 
and your brand position as being elite there  
then you can do a mid-level and then over time you 
can trickle down and do a larger you know larger  
uh lower cost item for the base of the pyramid 
most people do it backwards and do it wrong and  
you know try and compete against lots of people 
when they're when they're not even that good and  
that's the reality right because most people don't 
make money because they're just not that good at  
the thing they think they're good at because if 
they were good then they would be making money  
absolutely absolutely and when 
you said the start to the most  
expensive thing um i noticed when i tell people 
charge more or you know start with you know what  
they say i don't get people who pay me that 
money or you know um how do i get people to  
pay me that much right so how do you usually 
communicate that to overcome that particular  
mind challenge yeah so people will pay you for 
the value you're currently trying to provide  
that's the issue right is that they won't pay 
you for what your comma for what you're trying  

6
00:05:00.000 --> 00:06:00.000
to provide them right but if you try and provide 
in excess of that and so as a thought experiment  
or a thought example think of this let's say we 
said um well if you're in the if you're if you're  
selling any kind of b2b thing right which would 
be like how to increase how much money you make  
let's just let's just start there because there's 
a lot of people who are here probably in that  
space yeah if i were to say i can double how 
much you're making or if people aren't making  
money who you're serving they'll say i can add 10 
000 months your income within 90 days guaranteed  
or i'll pay you twice for the cost of 
the program at the end of the 90 days
how difficult would it be for you to sign people 
up not hard at all how difficult would it be for  
you to get someone to pay you ten thousand 
dollars to make ten thousand dollars a month  
well considering colleges graduate people who are 
gonna make fifty thousand dollars after waiting  
four years and people pay two hundred thousand 
dollars for that i think it's reasonable believe  
that people would pay between 10 20 30 000 
for that skill and so then the question is  
or what i would normally get after that it's like 
well i can't do that alex i don't know how to get  

7
00:06:00.000 --> 00:07:00.000
someone i can't guarantee that outcome then 
it's like aha then let's solve the problem  
which is that you don't know how to do that 
now we have a solvable proposition that we  
can get better at whereas i don't know how to get 
customers sure that is also a solvable thing but  
in my opinion you would be best served honing 
the craft and finding a way to fill in such a  
way that you could guarantee that within reason 
and if that's the thought experiment and on the  
other extreme you have buy my thing and maybe you 
win and maybe you don't and i get paid either way  
that's the essence of what most people's offer is 
if we just boiled it down to soups and nuts right  
and so if this is one extreme where everybody 
says yes and lots of people want to buy from you  
and on this extreme you have it's very difficult 
to get customers there is somewhere on this  
continuum ideally one or two shades from this 
side right from the more compelling side that  
you can sell and can't offer and can fulfill on 
um in a way that will get people better results  
so the example that i give for a lot of 
agencies because a lot of people who are  
starting out learning facebook ads it's a basic 
skill and then they try and sell those services  

8
00:07:00.000 --> 00:08:00.000
if i were starting over again i would not try 
and do that what i would do is i would go find  
the avatar that i like locally and say okay 
mr dry cleaner mr chiropractor or mr whatever  
i will run your ads for free and i would like to 
own the entire process and so hey you just cover  
the advertising i'll work your leads i'll work 
your front desk i'll sell the people and what you  
could even do is just negotiate a bulk rate hey if 
i got you a thousand customers tomorrow what's the  
lowest you could possibly do it for maybe it says 
200 for whatever the widget is right you say cool  
and then you go ahead and sell for 800 and you 
make 600 on every one of these deals and you  
pay him as 200 to go fulfill and the rest of its 
margin right the beauty is that you would learn  
every aspect of how to provide value to that 
avatar because i'll tell you a story to drive  
this home i had an agency owner who was on our 
software platform and i have you know we have one  
call every month or something um that i hop on and 
i've seen it's the same conversation every month  

9
00:08:00.000 --> 00:09:00.000
hey you know my customers suck no one wants to pay 
me blah blah blah and you know over and over again  
i was like you're not good that's why they're not 
paying you you're not very good you need to get  
better right and so i every time i was like dude 
stop saying that they tell you that their system's  
bad and you say it's good and they say it's 
bad why don't you go and he was he was selling  
to realtors you're selling leads to realtors 
to houses and i said go get your real estate  
license go work the leads that you're getting 
right now and go sell some houses for a year  
then when people say that something's not working 
you can help them because you've actually done it  
everyone's so consumed with trying 
to sell something they've never done  
that they're surprised that they're not good at  
absolutely it's the it's the business guru who who 
coaches on how to have a business who never had a  
business and his entire business was coaching on 
how to have businesses right that guy never gets  
big you'll make some money but you'll never 
get big true and sonya is asking um how can  

10
00:09:00.000 --> 00:10:00.000
guarantee results on the relationship market 
dating family with marriage etc so if you want  
to do that one more time yeah how can guarantee 
results on the relationship market that's dating  
family marriage like how do you transfer 
that same guarantee to those kind of markets  
it's great so with those types of markets you 
just create so you create the guaranteer on  
the experience that they want to have all right 
so this is this is what's the beauty of being  
creative as a marketer or a business owner and 
i'm not saying the first guarantee is going to hit  
but if you interview your customers you say what 
would what would what is describe to me what you  
want your marriage to look like describe to me 
what you want to have happen for some of them it  
might be we go on dates again right we go on dates 
together once a week that might be what it looks  
like it might be we we finally sleep together 
again after a long time we haven't haven't been  
together it might be um it might just be that like 
we wake up in the morning we don't hate each other  
or we haven't had an argument in a week right it 
could be any of those types of outcomes depending  

11
00:10:00.000 --> 00:11:00.000
on what type of marriages or solutions i'm just 
using marriage as an example right and so it'll  
probably have to be around something a little 
bit more intangible right now the key here is  
even if you have something that is intangible you 
can still guarantee it because the good will from  
customers typically will still surpass the 
desire to refund what i mean by that is let's  
say you've got 10 customers and normally if you 
sold your normal services you'd only have three  
right but if you saw with a guarantee maybe you 
get 10. all right of the 10 maybe two of them say  
i didn't experience the result you were looking 
for right now of the other eight let's say you  
were you're promising they're going to sleep with 
their partner within 90 days i'm just throwing out  
there just as a crazy example all right and let's 
say at the end of 90 days they didn't sleep with  
their partner but if their relationship is 
significantly better and they feel like they  
are making progress towards that goal they will 
not ask for a refund people want to see progress  
right and so what's important is and also in 
terms of the language the messaging you use  
when you're talking to your audience this is what 
i try and talk to you in terms of everyone here  

12
00:11:00.000 --> 00:12:00.000
when i talk to entrepreneurs is that we have 
this psychological uh bias again towards binary  
thinking which is yes or no good marriage 
bad marriage right when it's much more to  
what extent or how good is my marriage right 
so it's a rate it's a scale it's not yes or no  
and so if you can teach your clients to think 
you know on a continuum rather than in the binary  
you'll shift their thinking enough that it won't 
even matter because if that made that frame shift  
then you will have gotten them on a progression 
that they will be able to continue to improve over  
time and they will contribute that improvement 
to the intervention that you've provided for them
so so basically it's selling the 
experience to them and basically  
ensuring that they get progress 
along the journey yeah awesome  
yeah so i would just like to ask like when it 
comes to qualifying the avatar that deserves your  
grand slam offer right i mean you won't just put 
together a very good offer and give it to anyone  
because it might be difficult to get the results 
because you have maybe they have a broken system  

13
00:12:00.000 --> 00:13:00.000
or something so how do you how did you do um make 
that process work i know you stayed with james  
um but you know in other verticals where it's 
difficult to predict certain things how would  
you do yeah i mean we have we have business 
opportunity companies we have we have photography  
companies for children we have a company that does 
um like i said we have a software that is lead  
working we have uh e-commerce company we have uh 
the licensing company so we have a vast you know  
a vast array of different different companies that 
we have a certification company um vast array of  
different things the the the important part is i 
actually totally forgot the question i'm so sorry  
yeah i mean qualifying avatars right that's 
you would yeah yeah yeah yeah so so you can  
increase the quality of your product by 
increasing the quality of your prospects  
again you can increase the quality of your product 
when you increase the quality of your prospects  
and so the easiest way to look at this is look at 
the customers that you like the most the ones who  

14
00:13:00.000 --> 00:14:00.000
have had the most success you sing your praises 
right sing your songs and look at them and then  
compare them to the people who you do not like 
who who haven't had a good experience and then  
what you do is you go backwards 90 days and say 
what was the experience the people who one had in  
their first month what are the things they did 
that were different than the people who failed  
once you could delineate what those things were 
it might be milestones that are achieved there  
might be a certain percentage of material that 
was watched it could have been it could have  
been coaching calls attended whatever type of 
solution you're providing marriage weight loss  
business whatever right it could be any of 
those things right and there's probably some  
associated action that has to go with it if it 
was weight loss it might be logging food if it  
was business it might be sending emails 
if it was if it was marriage it might be  
it might be uh putting you know filling out the 
checklist of things they love about their partner  
whatever it is right what are those milestones 
that have to occur to activate the customer  
so that they're likely to experience the outcome 
that you were you're you're promising them  
and so what the metrics of your customer journey 
should look like and your customer success team  

15
00:14:00.000 --> 00:15:00.000
should be driving towards those activation points 
those milestones so if we know that people who  
have both spouses who fill out the checklist of 
the things they like about each other and their  
favorite memories of their relationship we know 
that if both people fill that out and they attend  
two calls in their first 14 days the likelihood 
that they finish the program and experience great  
results is three times as high so then all of 
your effort goes towards pushing them through  
that milestone so that they can change the color 
of their flag and then get to where you want to  
go so that's ultimately how you can change the 
and and when you're looking at reverse that's  
the experience side that's the fulfillment side 
but you might also note that this person uh you  
know has a business or is gainfully employed and 
this person is unemployed and a stay-at-home mom  
okay well then these are the people not only they 
did this experience which i'm going to try and do  
on my back end but on the front end i'm going 
to try and weed out these people and actively  
select for these people and then what's beautiful 
about that is that is an element of niching right  
and so when you're making your messaging you're 
making your creative and your marketing you can  

16
00:15:00.000 --> 00:16:00.000
speak more specifically to that avatar rather than 
all marriage you know relationships that you're  
helping you help uh you know uh stay-at-home moms 
with working working husbands achieve a better  
marriage who are between the ages of 30 and 50. 
if you're that avatar you're like [ __ ] that's  
me or it's i help entrepreneurial men you know 
fall back in love with their wives again whatever  
right like whatever your outcome is but you 
can be more specific about it and in so doing  
you can command higher prices because you can 
you can you can provide more tailored solutions  
which in a very real way provides more value to 
that avatar even if the fulfillment looks the same
got it so um so so basically let's assume now this 
is uh um like you know my space is basically cost  
creation i have cost creators so if if i want to 
work with people who are more further along with  
that cost journey i know i've made certain skills 
right i basically have to you know it's it affects  

17
00:16:00.000 --> 00:17:00.000
i basically have to like tailor my and you know 
for me i i focus on course creators who are like  
in business cosplays who are you know trying 
to sell courses that give people a financial  
alright right so it's it's just basically you 
know tweaking your messaging so so focus on  
those people and you know without every other 
person who is in other species 100 yeah awesome  
so i'll give you an example and for some reason 
it's harder for people but the thing is is that  
they don't change the economics of their business 
when they change the economics of the avatar and  
that's where you get into trouble so for example 
whatever your price point you're selling at right  
now if you change your avatar from anybody who's 
a course creator to people who have high business  
roi then you'll probably be providing far more 
value to those people one because your process  
will be more more tailored to their approach 
but also because if they're selling business  
stuff then they're probably going to be able to 
charge higher premiums for it and so as a result  
if they experience a transformation using your 
you know your system etc then they're going to  

18
00:17:00.000 --> 00:18:00.000
make real money right and so if you decide to be 
more selective with that avatar then that should  
be reflected in the pricing and the fulfillment 
that goes along with that so the the easy example  
is we made a decision very early on because i was 
in the gym space that we were helping gym owners  
we were not helping personal trainers we're not 
helping online trainers we're not helping health  
coaches we're helping just micro gym owners and 
so by doing that half to two-thirds the volume  
that i would get every single day of people that 
that were opting for stuff were not qualified but  
the people who tried to compete with us and tried 
to sell all of them wasted so much time because  
the ltv of those customers was so low and the 
amount that they required was so high and the  
amount that you'd have to go from zero to one 
for so many of these people which is the heaviest  
lifting in all of business is getting someone to 
make their first dollar i had no interest in doing  
that i wanted to take people were making half a 
million dollars a year and get them to a million  
a very simple outcome it's all i'm doing and 
i consistently would just do that we just  

19
00:18:00.000 --> 00:19:00.000
take you from half a million to a million half 
a million to a million because that's something  
that i can repeatedly do over and over and 
over again and i can demonstrate that value  
in a very very high degree of success and so if 
i do that then i have a very demonstratable way  
to provide value and i can monetize that value 
accordingly and i can do with lots of operational  
efficiency since the the the the process is so so 
clear-cut between each app between each customer  
awesome awesome so uh talk to us a bit about grow 
or die i mean that's one of your tenants in your  
company right however yeah you talked about 
um is its market efficiency or basically the  
market is growing by 17 percent every year and 
um if you don't skip up you basically are you  
know going backwards so how do you tweak your 
offers in your companies every single year or  
every single you know what period of time 
how do you how do you work around this
i think it's more understanding that we have 
it's more about embracing change and about  
being flexible in terms of like the goals 
that we set we we you would be surprisingly  

20
00:19:00.000 --> 00:20:00.000
bored by the types of goals that we set within 
our company you know i can tell you the last  
quarter's goals we always trickle back to the 
same things because it's either if we're going  
to grow we can only do two things we can either 
get more customers we can make them worth more  
that's it and so we'll have two to three goals 
tops we never have more than that uh for the  
company that'll be like okay well we're going to 
take we're gonna take wherever we see the weakest  
point within our within our pipeline uh which 
maybe the pipeline's great it's like okay well we  
just need a double front end volume but i wouldn't 
make the goal of doubling front end volume i would  
probably make the goal of bumping front end volume 
by 10 to 15 percent that would be the goal for the  
quarter and i would say we need to ascend we 
need to take our customer ascension from 40  
to 50 that would be the back end upgrade right 
that would be one is getting more customers the  
second is making them worth more and that would 
be literally the goal for the entire company and  
so then the directors would come up and say 
okay well i think in order for us to get a 15  
boost in volume uh you know based on our total 
call volume right now we would need to add  

21
00:20:00.000 --> 00:21:00.000
three more outbound uh outbound development reps 
uh to the call team and that would mean we need to  
have add one uh sales development specialist which 
is our mid-level sales person and one more closer  
it's like okay so we need to hire five people 
and great that's what that's what we're gonna  
do and maybe we need to hire six or seven because 
we might not get the the ones that we want to keep  
on the first go around that's what we're gonna 
do for the front end that is the tactics of how  
that's gonna happen and then on the back end 
uh what we're gonna do is we're going to add  
you know these two touch points in and we're 
gonna make this process that's been a little  
bit difficult for them a little easier so that 
hopefully we can get another 10 of those people to  
upgrade i mean that is how we improve the business 
we're not doing rocket science here um we're just  
trying to improv you know incrementally improve 
these things and if i improve by you know 15 on  
both those metrics every quarter in six quarters 
the numbers become crazy right and so i think a  
lot of people are um they try to they try to they 
try to solve 100 problems at the same time and  

22
00:21:00.000 --> 00:22:00.000
it's just it's it's impossible for your team it's 
you can't you need focus focus is knowing what  
you're going to say no to not what you want to do 
there's a hundred things we all should do and for  
perspective for everyone we crossed 50 million 
in sales before we started doing email follow-up  
wow because i always felt like we had 
there were other opportunities that  
had more juice to squeeze than email follow-up for 
me and my business and so that whole time when we  
were 10 million at 20 million to 30 million 
we should have been doing email follow-up but  
there were other things we should have done 
more which is what we did and so it's just  
about knowing what we're going to say no to and 
the one or two things that we're going to say yes  
to because i think most people wildly overestimate 
what they can accomplish in a short period of time  
true so now when because you said you said 
um there are so many problems that you know  
a business or an individual or a market faces 
and you know in your book you said you should  
solve every single problem right and this is 
basically you know tackling i mean how does that  

23
00:22:00.000 --> 00:23:00.000
because when i try to introduce that to some 
people it felt like i mean it's a lot of work  
literally writing about a hundred 
and twenty something problems right  
and trying to solve every one of them so i 
mean how how does that affect your markets  
so you have to solve every perceived problem 
right the way in which you solve that that  
comes down to the delivery cube which is in the 
book right so i'll give an example let's say i  
use weight loss because everyone understands it 
so if i had a girl and she needs to lose weight  
there's a lot of things that she has to do that 
are different now than she was doing before so she  
might now have to buy groceries differently than 
she did before she started working with me right  
just as a simple example now there is a zillion 
ways i can solve that problem so it's not that  
you have to go grocery shopping for every customer 
it's that you have to solve the problem around the  
difficulty of grocery shopping so for example i 
could have a pre-made instacart uh for you know  

24
00:23:00.000 --> 00:24:00.000
for six sets of customers at different weights 
that i could copy and paste to her and then she  
could click one click and she gets it ordered her 
house easy i could make custom lists uh you know  
i could make an excel sheet that adjusts based 
on every customer if they enter their weight in  
that adjust the grocery list for the week that's 
the second one i can make pre-made lists not even  
a calculator just pre-made pdfs for 100 different 
you know weight scales and so that way it's still  
tailored to them but i do that work up front and 
then after that it's just plug and play right i  
could do a a large group grocery shopping tour 
so everyone meets there and then we go grocery  
shopping together if i want to do it virtually i 
could do a virtual grocery store or i could do the  
live one record it and then make that the thing 
that i'm saying is the fulfillment i could also do  
a 101 grocery kind of like i'll help them create 
it together as a one-on-one session as a bonus  
uh for signing up for my weight loss program 
um i could like you see what i'm saying here  
like there's all i did was there's one problem 
yeah and we just looked at how many you know i  

25
00:24:00.000 --> 00:25:00.000
could offer tech support so when you go to the 
grocery store you can text me and i'll help you  
uh pick anything that if you have trouble 
with it i could have phone call support  
like the list goes on and so it's really just 
limited by your creativity in terms of what you  
want to do notice half of those things were not 
creating anything it was just being available  
right and if i had tech support compared to a pdf 
most people would probably value the tech support  
higher i may or may not be willing to do that on 
a level fulfillment which again i would go back  
to my first tenant which is if you don't have that 
many customers be willing to do more so that you  
can over deliver learn more about them and then 
over time become more operationally efficient  
but big picture yes we want to solve every problem 
in some way and then over time what will improve  
your product and your business is how effectively 
you solve that problem relative to the cost to you  
absolutely that is fundamental like amazon 
took tons of time to invest in building that  
infrastructure but now the marginal cost 
of a new customer on amazon is nothing  

26
00:25:00.000 --> 00:26:00.000
right or very low right and so it you can either 
put the the workload on the front of it on the  
back end i prefer to do it on the front end and 
consistently improve on it um and that's where you  
have customer surveys and as you're fulfilling 
which is why i like more hands-on approaches  
in the beginning because you're learning more 
about the customer right like that that data and  
the stories behind what you're going to discover 
there are so valuable um it's silly not to do it  
in my opinion yeah absolutely so i mean when now 
comes to selling this offer right you are putting  
putting out this offer and you know usually when 
we say we're on sales calls we basically have um  
one to five things we just want to double around 
three to five things you won't see on this call  
how then do you include all this you just wait 
for them to get to the point of your objection  
and then you just if they say um i can't you 
know i can't do this then you tell them oh  
yeah i have i've discovered so is that how you 
like you know think around yeah if you're in a  
one-on-one selling if you're in a one-on-one 
selling situation you want to include those  

27
00:26:00.000 --> 00:27:00.000
bonuses because you want to over deliver so if 
i didn't promise you something and then when you  
buy it you get more than i promised you you're 
happy that's the point we want happy customers  
if when we get on the sales call they they're they 
say you know i got to think about it then we would  
ask the first op the the simplest question in 
all of sales which is what's your main concern  
what are you afraid of having happen if 
this went poorly what would that look like  
and what they'll do is they'll tell you what 
their fears are and then it's up to us to say  
totally understand every customer i have is the 
exact same fears and here's how we make sure  
that's not going to happen fair enough and then 
we go for the sale right so it's just very just  
and if they say no it's like what else is your 
main concern what else are you concerned about  
right and then they'll tell you something else 
and you're like totally understand so we did to  
make sure you do that a little quick and a doubt 
about how we made it and that's how you won't have  
to struggle with that issue fair enough and we 
just keep going back over and over and over again  
about how we've solved the problem and then 
we present the offer again yeah and and when  

28
00:27:00.000 --> 00:28:00.000
you were traveling to gyms at the start of your 
journey um you know and you were helping them  
get more customers were you also working on 
your offers and how did you call their offers  
yeah on the offers like them yeah so for them i 
already knew what the offer was okay so i already  
had the best converting off and i already had 
all the bonuses made so i white labeled all the  
bonuses that i had spent all my time providing so 
you're like how am i going to do all this work i'm  
like i already did all the work for you i made the 
groceries i made the food preparation structure  
they made it the outcome i made the the liquor 
fingers lunches the the delectable dinners the  
the the banging breakfast the the shake guide i 
made all of those things and i made them for four  
different weight classes so they had 40 different 
deliverables that they could just slap their logo  
on and then i made i showed the video on how to 
slap your logo on this thing so that they could  
make it easier for them right i provided all that 
stuff and then i spent my own money i worked the  
leads myself i sold them myself and then i taught 
them how to fulfill those customers in person  
and i did that for almost two years they do it one 
time and they're like ah why am i not a guru well  

29
00:28:00.000 --> 00:29:00.000
you have to be really good i think i think 
that's probably the reason why nichington  
is really important right really listening 
to an avatar that you can really like you  
have basically everything laid out for them you 
can just program play yeah makes a lot of sense  
um so you know basically when it comes surprising 
okay i think i've asked you this already  
um yeah when you you said at the beginning of 
your journey um you were basically building out  
of scarcity as you were building your businesses 
out of scarcity because you wanted to make money  
now if you have to go back in time because quite 
a number of people here i probably have supports  
where they need to make money and now we are 
basically giving a story would you still be  
put on a quote giving it all away if you went 
back in time with your mindset currently when  
you're in terms of building your business and 
starting out more how would you approach yeah  
it's a great question um i think that i would more 
quickly pivot to where i'm at now um and probably  

30
00:29:00.000 --> 00:30:00.000
instead of taking so long to do it but i mean i 
would still satisfy my immediate needs you know i  
mean like if i if i need to go make money i would 
go make sure that i was that i was making money  
but i might do it differently and so that's one 
of the difficulties is that like i have context  
um and skills now that i didn't have when 
i started so if i were to start over again  
i would probably be able to do things that i 
didn't know how to do when i started so i would  
see opportunities in a very different way i would 
know how to build the business so much faster  
um than i do now or sorry then i did that and 
so i mean if you're operating out of scarcity  
i completely understand i i tend to just lean 
towards stop trying to be cute and stop it try  
to be fancy and and just find you know find an 
avatar that you like and do everything you can  
to solve their problem right everyone just gets 
so obsessed with their revenue metrics and their  
the other thing is they forget about the 
customer so like just go crazy on the customer  
and if you can do that you'll make the money and 
then and then you can pick like ultimately you'll  

31
00:30:00.000 --> 00:31:00.000
the more money you make is the the longer you 
give before you ask the more money you'll make  
and i'll tell you a big wealth secret if 
you give enough you don't ever have to ask  
people who just come to you and they'll 
give to you without you ever asking  
basically better than the jump jump job right 
right i mean gary v talks about two so it's not  
just like he talks about it as he's mentioned this 
so it's not it's not me saying anything different  
than him but um if you just give more and so the 
the real real is if you can satisfy your immediate  
needs right you can satisfy your immediate needs 
for food and shelter if you can take a longer term  
perspective you will win much better much faster 
because goodwill multiplies faster than revenue  
and so you want to hold back that ask as long as 
humanly possible and if you do hold it back as  
long as humanly possible you'll be surprised that 
you will monetize without even needing to try yeah  
this is just my my per my first hand experience 
with this and you might be like alex sure you  

32
00:31:00.000 --> 00:32:00.000
can say that now because you've x y and z and sure 
right i can't have a long-term perspective because  
i don't need i don't need any of that stuff but 
i'm telling you it is a better business strategy  
like it is and that's why you look at the biggest 
companies in the world that give they give so much  
value for free and they find otherwise to monetize 
them right like gmail it's free like how crazy is  
that it's free they made gmail for free right 
google we could use it for free we get to use  
youtube for free it's nuts right and they find 
other ways to monetize it so that that's kind of  
the idea here is that like and a lot of times when 
people are starting out they're afraid of giving  
their secret sauce away and the answer is you 
should always just give away as much as you really  
can and i know that i'm giving away the quote 
right amount when i'm afraid of how much value  
awesome like if you're not afraid of how 
much you're giving away it's not enough
yeah you should have anxiety about it  
yeah awesome i mean i mean um so someone is 
asking and i think i would just tie this to the um  

33
00:32:00.000 --> 00:33:00.000
you know the passive likelihood of achievement she 
said how do you handle clients um on course asking  
for testimonial or references for a new offer and 
you know basically i think that's basically trying  
to communicate to them that this they're more 
like you know the the likelihood of results high  
but this time is a new offer so how do you do so 
do you frame with that how the frame is basically  
well you run a beta group i mean this one's 
i mean that's the like if you've never done  
it before then don't promise something go take 
20 people and say i'll do it for free as long  
as you give me a testimonial and you give me fair 
feedback so i can help you throughout this process  
i mean i spent two years going from gym to gym 
for no money no so like i'm like i'd live to this  
people do it for a month i did it for two years 
you know i'm just i'm just putting perspective  
on this like the the the wider the base of the 
pyramid which is the foundation that you decide  
to lay in terms of the depth of your skill the 
taller the peak is like you like there's no

34
00:33:00.000 --> 00:34:00.000
for fear of sounding trite there's no there's no 
shortcut like the the height of your pyramid will  
be determined by your skill set the depth of your 
skill the depth of your roots that you've planted  
and the depths comes from repetition it comes 
from volume it comes from scale it comes from time  
right it's time under the bar a lot of people 
just aren't willing to do that that's why most  
people won't be won't be this won't be won't 
achieve the level of success they desire  
they want it so bad they're not willing 
to wait but the only way to get it  
is to wait long enough that it becomes inevitable
yeah i mean it's sometimes so hard 
yeah yeah it looks so hard to wait  
sometimes because i mean you really have 
to you know cover the views i know it's  
just because of comparison though it's not 
actually hard to wait you know my my my dad  
said this to me and i think there's there's 
some wisdom in it he said you know what no  
matter how much money you make he said chicken 
tastes like chicken and rice tastes like rice

35
00:34:00.000 --> 00:35:00.000
nothing changes it's just it's just people feel 
like they're quote falling behind from some dude  
on instagram is probably lying right it's just 
you know it just even like in my stuff some people  
compared their numbers to my numbers and like how 
many years have you been in business right now  
my current advice two years three years right  
so for context my third year in business 
i think i made fifty thousand dollars
my fourth year in business i 
made fifty thousand dollars  
right and so like people see what we're doing 
now and they're like oh my god like i've been  
almost a decade you know and like we're now just 
receiving some level of notoriety and candidly the  
other part of it is that we made our money doing 
the thing rather than teaching how to do the thing  
and i think that's lost in a lot of people yeah  
everyone everyone gets to ten thousand a 
month and immediately makes the course on  
how to make 1000 a month yeah right rather than 
why don't you go to a hundred thousand a month  

36
00:35:00.000 --> 00:36:00.000
why don't go do a million a month why don't 
you just keep doing the thing that you're doing
options yeah yeah man great i mean so 
much wisdom here um i think i'll just  
probably take this one as a last question 
um someone says how as a virtual assistant  
how do you position your agency for 
high-paying clients so i guess um that probably  
already do you have any do you have 
any uh specific unique answers to that
well i think there would be a 
business model question too so  
you know there's there's a number of different 
models you can do there you could specialize  
in creating one specific type of one specific 
type of service provider so let's say you  
were like i will train people on how to run ads 
and so you say hey i'll give you a media buyer  
um for you know ten thousand dollars one time and 
i'll be fully trained and after that it's only  
you know 200 bucks a month right or whatever you 
know whatever the income of the va is right that  

37
00:36:00.000 --> 00:37:00.000
would be one model you know another model could be 
same concept in terms of what you do but you might  
monetize by saying hey you can pay me a thousand 
dollars a month and i'll assign you a full-time  
rep and you pay 200 a month to the person the 
whole time and as long as they stay an employee  
of that of that company that becomes a staffing 
play from like you become like a staffing company  
for payroll that has very very good enterprise 
value has really good stick rates for the most  
part as long as the people are good and so it 
really just depends on what the skills so again  
if you have a high level of skill you 
can teach people the high level skill  
which means that you can sell the high level skill 
on their behalf to other people for more money  
if you are not that skilled you will not be able 
to teach a high level of skill and so that you  
won't be able to sell a high level of skill 
on their behalf so it all comes still back to  
like what's the value that we can provide and 
the better you can get at both acquiring the  
skill for yourself and teaching the skill in a 
replicable way then if you do that then you'll  
always be able to provide value right because 
you're helping this person who's the va get  
probably better income than they would normally 
be able to get you're going to help the business  

38
00:37:00.000 --> 00:38:00.000
owner get labor for lower than they normally would 
be able to back and there's this knight's delta  
of room and that's where you can extract the value 
that you want for yourself for connecting the tail  
awesome awesome um and just just because 
i have heard you say this quite often  
quite a while recently about the five 
different channels of lead generation  
i'm talking about one media enemy there are six 
rider six yeah one with that end media um you know  
a paid traffic you know outreach and you know 
referrals i talk about five of them in linear  
one being quadratic because sonya is asking 
about organic markets and how you feel about it  
so i feel that maybe you could just elaborate on 
that in these rooms sure so like amino just said  
there's a lot of ways to acquire customers right 
and each of the strategies is pros and cons um  
if you're at zero to a million you just need to 
pick one you have to pick one and become a master  

39
00:38:00.000 --> 00:39:00.000
at it because that's you when you're starting 
out you have no leverage once you get higher up  
you'll still probably need to learn a second one 
or scale that one even higher to maybe you know  
three million a year and then at that point you'll 
have enough leverage from a monetary perspective  
that you can find someone who's good at another 
channel bring them in and then have them build out  
a second channel and then find someone else who's 
good at it and build out another channel you can't  
try and pay someone to learn it that's a dumb idea 
find someone who's already done it for a business  
that's similar to yours and then have them build 
out that team on that channel um so in terms of  
what are my feelings on organic marketing i mean 
i'm a huge fan if you're very good uh kylie jenner  
it's worked great for kim kardashian's work great 
for rihanna that's worked great for her right  
so if you have if you have star power and you're 
good on camera or you look amazing or or you have  
or you're amazing at delivering content and the 
way that you define that is if you make stuff and  
people share it and subscribe to your channel or 
follow you or download your podcast then you're  
good at it if you do it and none of that happens 
then you're not that good at it and so i think the  

40
00:39:00.000 --> 00:40:00.000
the lesson at least for the organic stuff is you 
can start investing in that stuff now because in  
time you'll get better at it and it'll be a hockey 
stick for two years three years nothing will  
happen and then all of a sudden you'll get good 
enough after you make 100 videos or 200 videos 300  
videos you'll learn your voice learn how to speak 
you'll learn your keys and you'll start to really  
develop something that becomes more interesting 
to an audience right it's okay to suck i think  
everyone just doesn't give themselves permission 
to suck but uh in terms of speed to money right  
uh paid traffic is the fastest it also 
requires the most skill and requires capital  
so not everyone's in that situation so if you're 
looking for the cheapest fastest then you're  
you're pretty much left with three channels right 
um which is going to be your owned media which is  
all the contacts you already have in your cell 
phone your your followers on facebook your on  
instagram your friends on facebook all those 
people have given you permission to access them  
so that's the fastest and cheapest and probably 
highest likelihood of success for most people who  
are starting out you probably have between all 
those at least 2 000 people who between all the  

41
00:40:00.000 --> 00:41:00.000
sources i just said that doesn't even include a 
customer list just just that so it's 2000 people  
you can reach out to if you reach out to 100 
people a day it would take you 20 days just to get  
through the list once so you could have multiple 
runs at that list and you'd probably have enough  
cash flow and experience to then go to either 
cold outbound because you'd learn enough from  
the warm to extrapolated to cold which would be a 
second a second uh way which is fast uh in terms  
of like you can you can make some money and it 
costs you very little because it's just your time  
uh but scaling it requires people so you have two 
people doing that five people doing that 20 people  
doing outbound on your behalf um the the the next 
way uh is affiliates and that's probably like  
if i had to start over tomorrow and i had to make 
a ton of money it would be how do i find partners  
that already have my client base that i can tap 
into and create some sort of value proposition to  
them to make it a win and so my last two companies 
um were off that strategy you know what i mean  
so my supplement company is based on affiliate 
network it's not it's not only direct response

42
00:41:00.000 --> 00:42:00.000
awesome so how do i feel about organic if 
you're good at it it's worth it it takes  
time and if you need to feed yourself 
today i would do that so that eventually  
you'll get the dividends but i would still 
like your your money is going to be like  
make sure you don't get obsessed with 
that i would say take the two hours a week  
do the do the two or three videos or a podcast 
or whatever it is that you want to do and then  
the remainder of your week is focused on making 
money awesome ask about facebook bruce facebook  
groups are fine it's just it's a it's a version of 
owned or uh earned media yeah yeah awesome and um  
your book the next week coming out to 600 
million dollars generation or which of them  
exactly degenerates yeah i think it'll be lee 
jenner i think lead generation will be number two  
um and then the third one will be money models 
which is kind of the uh originally was called  
monetization structures but i have a feeling 
that doesn't sound as sexy as money models so  
i'll call it money models but it's basically all 
the different ways that you can structure offers  
to monetize uh off promotions and so there's 19 
different offer structures that i have in the book  

43
00:42:00.000 --> 00:43:00.000
um it's one of the ones that i'm actually the most 
afraid of publishing it was the first book i wrote  
because i think it's like the stuff that i geek 
out the most about but i'm i'm i'm not sure if  
it's going to be too dense so i might i might 
have to figure out how to make it really readable  
uh for people because it's it's you know it's 
offer combinations how to sell continuity down  
sells upsells like all the different kind of like 
metrics and things like that that you need to  
look at but i'm not sure if it's going to be too 
boring so i'm trying to make it really interesting  
all right yeah um yeah and you basically have 
about six more so you said is it nine in twitter  
i think i think i'll have 10 in total i know the 
first six and i'm sure that once i write the six  
i'll probably have three or four more that'll come 
out of it but it'll be so we have offers first  
we'll have lead generation second i think money 
models will be third sales will be fourth sales  
teams will be fifth um increasing uh lifetime 
gross profit per customer will be six i'll  
probably come up with a sexier name for that but 
that's what it is it's making more per customer  

44
00:43:00.000 --> 00:44:00.000
um and then i'll probably end up making some sort 
of one around uh money just money in general uh  
money beliefs wealth stuff um i'll probably make 
something around uh buying and selling businesses  
um and so i'll let it evolve over time 
but the first the first six are pretty  
pretty clearly defined i already have those 
wireframed out in the first the next two  
books are already pretty much written um i just 
have to go back over them and re-edit them and  
try and simplify them and make them easier to 
read and put more pictures and all that stuff  
awesome right so um i mean it's been really 
awesome no know listening to you and get to  
speak with you and also get to answer questions 
from everyone here um it's been a pleasure  
right um so i would just like to know 
you know what's next for you maybe in the  
next you know after you're done with all 
these you know books and their worstness
well that'll probably take me a few years

45
00:44:00.000 --> 00:45:00.000
i mean acquisition.com and the courses and 
books that are going to come out for free  
from there that's kind of just a passion work 
i'll probably continue to do that as i acquire  
more skills and as beliefs change i'll 
probably also update some of them and  
re-release a few of them if like they change 
substantially or my views develop on them um  
but the the phase that i'm answering 
is i'm trying to just deploy capital  
um into small into small businesses so you know 
three five 10 20 million dollar businesses and  
you know invest in them and the entrepreneurs and 
then also you know use the resources that i have  
the connections that i have and then you know 
whatever strategic insights i can provide  
to help them grow so that's that that's that's 
pretty much what i think my my foreseeable future  
is going to be is that and then there's i'll 
probably layer in a strong element of philanthropy  
beyond the obvious of just giving away everything 
for free for everyone who's not a company  
um so that's just kind of so that's that's 
where it's at and i think that uh you know  

46
00:45:00.000 --> 00:46:00.000
layla and i have the goal of of giving away 
more than as being the couple that gave the most  
and so that's that's you know i don't know 
if i'll ever achieve that but that is the  
that is a goal we have because at the end of the 
day like there's one thing to to hold it all and  
then donate a bigger number because i think 
we'll be better at allocating capital than  
maybe a charity would be but you know in some 
ways it's like what's the point of accumulating  
it all then dying and giving it away it's like 
i'd almost rather i'd rather give less in an  
absolute amount and then enjoy the benefit 
but then i think is that me being selfish  
so i go through all of these different different 
versions of the same thing i'm like well does it  
matter from being selfish because it won't matter 
anyways um so anyway that's that's not to get  
sidetracked but that's where i where i head off 
into awesome thanks so much thank you so so much  
yeah so um for everyone listening um if you've not 
gotten alex definitely go get it i'll leave you a

i made it basically you know as free as i could 
make it on the platform they wouldn't let me go
