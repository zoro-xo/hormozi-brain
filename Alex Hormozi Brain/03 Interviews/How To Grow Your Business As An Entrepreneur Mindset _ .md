00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:00.000
most products suck
most products are not good enough you
know what i mean because if they were
exceptional then you wouldn't actually
have a customer issue
that's the thing right and so it's just
it's an easy scape you know like a
scapegoat of like i'm not successful
because i'm not one of these marketers
it's like no you're not successful
because your sucks like that's what
it is
but it's okay
[Music]
hey everybody this is jason mark
campbell and welcome back to superhumans

million dollar offer he is the man

entrepreneur an investor a
philanthropist it is the one and only
alex harmozy and he has launched a
series of gym and fitness centers and
really revolutionized the way that these
gyms operate across the world by using
interesting ways of presenting their
offers and this is really what we're
going to be talking about today we're
going to talk about what is a grand slam

2
00:01:00.000 --> 00:02:00.000
offer why is it that we need to look at
our businesses differently and not
necessarily look at competitors on how
we can just be slightly discounted maybe
do things a little better but how we do
it extremely better and his book really
breaks it down we're going to talk a lot
about it today and if you're not
familiar with this man i mean you should
know that his businesses and his company
serve over 4 500 plus companies as well
as 10 000 plus customers he has gyms
across the world that use his model and
at this point all of his umbrella
companies generate an upward of 85
million a year in cumulative sales
across various industries the man is an
acquisition and monetization expert he
is a guest contributor on forbes and
entrepreneur and he's here with us alex
thank you so much for being here
hopefully i'll live up to the
introduction
hell yeah man like i said like i just
finished your book and again i just want
to all the viewers like usually i
mentioned this at the end but if you're
in business you need to pick up a copy
of his book 100 million dollar offers it

3
00:02:00.000 --> 00:03:00.000
was one of the best books i've read in a
long long time as far as how much you
can apply what is being taught
but before we get into topic i there's
something i thought was very interesting
in your bio
and there was a a kind of a a mission or
a vision or at least a big goal that you
said about being the most jacked
billionaire and i wanted to ask you
about that well i just figured i was
trying to create a smaller category to
be number one and
i was gonna say do you have any
competitors well lee labrada i think is
worth about 600 million i think arnold's
just under a billion or just add a
billion so he'd probably be
i think i might have him now but he's
still arnold so i you know i either have
to get above that and still maintain my
jackness um i feel like i've seen memes
of jeff bezos looking pretty cut as well
he is i can't so hopefully hopefully but
i'll be more jacked than him
that that's hilarious but i mean think
of you you're like you're on your
journey already they're going to the
billion dollars here which is
fascinating and when i was going through
your book i love that you know there's a
moment of vulnerability you shared about
how this kind of started um because you

4
00:03:00.000 --> 00:04:00.000
had a moment where the cash flow wasn't
going right you had to make some big
decisions
so i wanted to go back to that original
point because a lot of people listening
might be saying like wow okay you've got
it all together you've probably all had
this
but you came from humble beginnings and
you had your own struggles
more struggles than wins is what it
feels like
i think i share like just one of the
ones like one of those moments in the
book there are there are many others
that are equally
desperate and destitute and hopeless
or seemingly hopeless uh but yeah i mean
i think the the introduction the book
tells about
the
the
basically the point where we pivoted
from
me actually running my own series of
gyms to flying out and starting to
fill other people's gyms up so we that's
when we started the turnaround business
so we turned around i think 33 gyms
in a matter of
like a year and a half
and then you know halfway through or

5
00:04:00.000 --> 00:05:00.000
near the end of that we transitioned to
do the licensing model
and
once we transitioned to the licensing
model that's what everything really kind
of took off i think one of the
interesting points for everyone who's
listening
about that story and i talk about it
more on the youtube channel but it's
like if you think about all of this as
kind of vessels for
skills traits beliefs
like you can have those same bucket of
skills like fundamentally i knew how to
market i knew how to sell i knew you
know decent amount about fitness
and you know my first opportunity
vehicle with that was i actually started
a charity called the free training
project where i trade people for free
and they would donate to a charity and
that was because i had a good consulting
job i didn't need the money and i just
wanted to help people
and then you know from there i i started
my first brick and mortar gym so that
was a different opportunity vehicle for
the same kind of skills you know etc
and i was able to scale those to six
locations and i was able to do it a
little bit differently than some people
did i was able to open up each of my
each of my facilities at full capacity
on the first day which i thought was
what everybody should do so i didn't
understand i thought i assumed everyone

6
00:05:00.000 --> 00:06:00.000
was doing that because i was like why
would you open an empty facility
but it turns out that wasn't common
but the the sec you know the next
iteration was flying out and doing this
for other people filling their gyms up
to full capacity in a month and so
that's yet another vehicle for the same
bucket of skills
and then from there you know transition
to the licensing model where it was i
still was fundamentally had the same
bucket of skills but in a different
monetization vehicle opportunity vehicle
and i think a lot of people
i mean i i almost wrote i'm not even
sure if this one's in the book but when
i when we transitioned to the licensing
model
i it was by accident it wasn't on
purpose so uh the the turnaround
business was difficult because we didn't
control the fulfillment so i would go in
and fill a facility up
i would i would take on all the
processing risks so i would spend the
money on airfare flights hotels ad
spends you know commissions to the sales
guys and i would process the money and
then the gym would get the client so it
was a grand slam offer they didn't have
to pay anything i would just fill their
gyms up right the deal for me is i would
get 100 of the revenue i would collect
that was the deal and then they would
get a free customer right

7
00:06:00.000 --> 00:07:00.000
the problem was that you know a handful
of them were not as
great people you know whatever you want
to call it don't mean it doesn't really
matter but they uh you know some of them
were like hey if i just ask these people
to refund once the guy leaves and then
sign up back through me it goes from
being a free customer to a paid customer
but i had already incurred all the costs
you know to do that and so
a couple months i had two gyms that did
that out of like the six or seven that
we had turned around and if you you know
you're running not 100 margin business
but maybe a 20 30 margin if you just get
erased
on you know 30 or 40 of top line because
it's refunded then that
more than eliminates your margin you're
going negative
and so it was actually in the kind of
that i don't think i'll talk about this
one in the book but that kind of moment
yeah that's a it's probably for my next
book um
that moment of kind of desperation i had
to sell more each month to cover the
refunds from the month month before
so in the book i talk about i just jump
over this because this is like a whole
nother part that sucked um i had to you
know every month i had to sell more
which it felt like a death trap because
it was like i just sell every i sold

8
00:07:00.000 --> 00:08:00.000
every ounce of my being to get to cover
last month's refunds and then this
month's would start coming in and i have
to sell more
so you know i went from just being a gym
owner to
within six months doing 400 000 a month
in cash collected or just under that to
cover refunds and it was just it was
just insane um and so my wife still had
her at the time she was my girlfriend
she still had a little side business uh
fitness
and
she it was like three or four thousand
dollars a month but it was she was like
just in case this guy you know
goes crazy or maybe he doesn't want to
you know date me anymore i've got this
thing going
and
i said you know what we know how to sell
weight loss why don't we why don't we
just sell your program i'll run you
become the face i'll run all the
marketing the sales and all that kind of
stuff
and we started to do it
so uh within 14 days we were doing a
thousand bucks a day and i was like holy
cow this could work i'll take the eight
sales guys that we had on the road we'll
bring them in we'll do eight thousand a
day and like we could turn this around
it was all digital products it was all
margin
and so i was like okay this is like
this could happen and so we actually

9
00:08:00.000 --> 00:09:00.000
made the decision to do that so that
that's not told in the book right um we
made the decision to make that call so
if you really want to talk about
opportunity vehicles this was yet
another opportunity vehicle for the
exact same bucket of skills right i knew
how to market how to sell now to do
fitness
and so the next month i had eight guys
that were supposed to launch eight gyms
that were supposed to launch the next
month and so i called them up and i said
hey you know we're not doing this
anymore we're kind of pivoting our model
they hadn't paid me anything so it
wasn't really a big deal
but they but it turned out it was a big
deal because they're like dude we need
this our gyms are going to close like
you know we're struggling
so finally i said um
you know i'll i'll show you how to do it
but i'm not going to fly out there to
save you if you can't sell like i'm
that's i'm just i'm done with that game
and they're like no no that's fine
that's reasonable it's okay and uh
they're like well how much to teach me
because like you filled my friend's gym
up and i was like and i picked the
highest number i could think of at the
time which was six thousand dollars like
that was the highest number just to show
you where you know that's where a
beliefs limiting issue right my belief
at the time not most likely and i i said
that because i thought i wanted him to
say no because i didn't want to do it i
wanted to just be done and and pivot to

10
00:09:00.000 --> 00:10:00.000
this weight loss thing
and he said yes
i wonder how different my life would be
if he had said no right but the next so
i was like holy cow i got six thousand
dollars and the next phone call i was
like well shoot i have to make this
thing now um and so next phone call i
went on and i said the same thing and he
said well how much and i said eight
thousand dollars and he said okay that
sounds fair
and so the rest of the day i had set six
more phone calls after that and i ended
up selling sixty thousand dollars in
sales that day and it was selling a
digital product i hadn't completely
finished yet
and um
so the next 48 hours i didn't sleep and
i finished uh basically the acquisition
piece so i already had the sales
training because that was how i trained
my zone sales guys i had all the
fulfillment stuff that i already made
for the gyms so i really just had to to
film how the marketing part worked how
the legion aspect worked
yeah uh
that i looked at layla and i said you
know i think we're still in the gym
business i was like i think we're just
doing it wrong and so that was actually
the the final that was kind of the final
pivot so there's this micropivot that
even happened between the turnaround
business and the licensing business and

11
00:10:00.000 --> 00:11:00.000
i stumbled into the licensing business
um unknowingly so it was not a master
plan and i think i think there's just
something to be said for like
you everyone has this illusion i think
when they're starting out that like the
business that they're in is going to be
the last business or there's going to be
their facebook and if you look at most
entrepreneurs even the greats a lot like
with the exception of jeff bezos like
just about every entrepreneur out there
had multiple things that happened
beforehand where you acquire these
skills these beliefs these decision
making processes that ultimately set you
up for the thing that is going to be the
massive success and a part of that which
you know to to to lend credence to what
you were saying in the beginning has
something to do with product market fit
which you know i just use the word offer
as an all-encompassing word to kind of
exhibit that but in the hardcore
business world they would just call that
product market fit and most people don't
have it they're trying to sell something
people don't want it and so it's trying
to figure out how to sell something like
what i found out which was hilarious to
me
was that i would go fill these gyms up
and they were like hey can you show me
how you did that and i was like no

12
00:11:00.000 --> 00:12:00.000
i was like no this is like this is how i
make my money i'm not going to show you
how i do it but it was silly because it
was such a scarcity mentality so it's
another belief that was limiting me at
the time
rather than just realize that the i'll
always be compensated for the amount of
value that i provide and it was far more
efficient to not have to pay somebody to
fly out stay in a hotel get a rental car
so there was all this value that i was
leaving for hotels and costs that i
could have otherwise been pushing to the
person who ultimately bought the
licensing program so they were still
doing so the average person who signed
on i just remembered these stats from
the first 30 days because i called back
all the turnaround gyms as soon as the
licensing thing started and i was like
hey remember that thing i did now you
want me to show you how to did it and
they're like sure
the average gym did over thirty thousand
dollars in additional cash collect their
first 30 days
so
the product worked right and it was also
exactly what they wanted and so uh and i
covered every single aspect of it
because i had done it for two years not
including the six gyms that i had on my
own so there was just a depth of
knowledge of like here's how you set up
your sales office here's how the lobby
works these are the questions you ask
when they walk in the door here's how

13
00:12:00.000 --> 00:13:00.000
you should do the tour so you can like
maximize likely that they buy here's
where you sit here's where they sit
here's the you know here's the
questionnaire you'll have them fill out
when you have them fill it out crouch
and be eye level with them because
you'll build rapport faster and they'll
be like they'll think that you're
accommodating them right
when they finish that then transition to
the office where you'll have an entire
wall of testimonials and all of your
degrees and stuff like that and then at
that you know what i mean so it's like
all of these things like this is the
offer these are the price points and
then i would give them all the
collateral that we already had that we
light labeled so they could slap their
logo on everything we had that i built
over six years and so automatically they
just had this turnkey just money making
machine that it's you know i took five
years six years for me to put together
okay you covered a lot of epic stuff
right there
this is amazing
i i wanted to go into one aspect here
because like
everything you've done like you have
amazing attention to detail you have
obviously this um this passion for sales
marketing and the fitness obviously
being the industry that you're in i i
just want to open up maybe a little side

14
00:13:00.000 --> 00:14:00.000
note here and ask about
the key skills and that you've developed
that have been extremely helpful in
building this up and it seems like this
idea of sales and marketing is one of
the important ones yeah is it something
you recommend everyone to develop or
should people be developing a key set of
skills and it doesn't necessarily need
to be those so
man if you had asked me this and you
know sometimes i struggle to answer
broader questions because my my my
answers have changed so much over time
and i wonder what i'll say in 10 years
and think that what i'm saying now is
stupid so
i say that as a disclaimer
there are three main skills that have to
exist for a business to flourish
and
flourish is a a tough word because
there's a lot of people who make a
million bucks two million bucks three
million bucks a year just knowing one of
them right and so the three main you
know sides of the stool for any business
are acquisition
delivery
right and and and shared services right
um and the delivery is going to be
product client experience et cetera

15
00:14:00.000 --> 00:15:00.000
you've got shared services which means
all the things to make sure you don't go
to prison right paying taxes doing hr
payroll
all that kind of stuff and then you have
the getting of customers right so you
got to get customers you got to fulfill
the thing that you said you were going
to do and you got to make sure no one
goes to prison and so those are kind of
the three circles as as as i see them
and so
naturally most people are not good at
all of them right we tend to have you
know natural dispositions or
proclivities towards one of those three
things some people are just naturally
more promotion type some people are
naturally product people um and
as i've as i've developed in the
entrepreneurial game i've connected with
more people i've met true product
entrepreneurs
and they have a completely different
outlook and some of them are still
wildly wildly wealthy right
but there's there's there's difficulties
for each of each of those paths are
difficult right they're just different
so the guys who are really good at
promoting
can never make anything stick they're
just pure marketing businesses and for
most people you know zero to one million
is just about learning how to sell one
one product to one person on one channel

16
00:15:00.000 --> 00:16:00.000
right very specific avatar very specific
problem one one specific channel of
acquisition if you can do that you go
from zero to a million right that's
that's what you can do
going from one to ten million is much
more about increasing lifetime gross
profit per customer which is going to
come down far more to the delivery in
the product so what's the experience and
what's the deliverable that they're
going to get and how likely is it that
they're going to pay pay a premium and
refer a friend right and so if we if you
nail that part down then all of a sudden
you can skyrocket from one to ten right
because the thing is so good that people
tell their friends about it and they and
the thing is it's not just that they
tell their friends you have so much more
good will you have higher ascension
rates
and the profit goes through the roof
when you don't have to keep reselling
people that's the piece that everyone
misses like
the reason that we took home 17 million
our second year in business off 28
million which is pretty insane as a
profit margin with that level of growth
going from we went from me in the book
having one thousand dollars in on
december 26
of 2017
to the same date 12 months later having

17
00:16:00.000 --> 00:17:00.000
three million dollars in profit in my
bank account after taxes
to 12 months after that having 17
million dollars in earnings now that i
had to write a nice 8 million tax bill
there but
you get you get what i'm saying here
right is that there's this massive jump
but the reason it was there was because
i had so much goodwill like the product
that i sold was 16 000 but i just told
you earlier that the average they cash
collected in the first 30 days was 30
grand so the value discrepancy and they
still had the system that they could use
the next month for 30 grand and the next
month for 30 grand the next month for 30
grand and so for me they were they they
were calling me back up like dude what
else do you have like i didn't need to
like there wasn't i didn't need to have
an ascension process they were like dude
i'll buy anything everything that you
sell i'm buying
and so i had to just create the track
afterwards and i said i don't know what
i'm going to build you but i promise
it'll be good and so i had all these
guys signed three-year agreements for
126 thousand dollars a pop
and there was no actual deliverable i
had zero they just they were like i
trust you you said what you're going to
do here what you delivered was far in
excess of that i'll sign up for the next

18
00:17:00.000 --> 00:18:00.000
thing because shoot the first thing pays
for the next thing and i think that's
one of the keys a lot of people don't
understand with continuity and having
ascension is that you buy
the goodwill
based on the first transaction
and the end of your quote value ladder
is the last time that you develop a
customer surplus
and so what a customer surplus is is the
difference in your price and your value
so you can charge a hundred percent of
your value and the price
and you will have what i would just
consider an economic exchange it's a
fair exchange of value the person leaves
satisfied they're not going to tell
their friends they might not buy again
but they are satisfied you're not going
to get chargebacks and refunds they're
like okay he said he would do this
that's what he did cool right but the
thing is is the more you can lower that
and the thing is there's two ways you
can
create that discrepancy you can raise
the value or you can lower the price for
most people lowering the price is not a
good way to do it right
but if you can raise the value then that
surplus you basically can carry forward
into your next sale but at the moment
that the next sale let's say your next
sale is five times the price whatever it

19
00:18:00.000 --> 00:19:00.000
doesn't matter
now that five times the price there's a
certain percentage of people that got
value in excess of five times what they
first bought and then they will buy the
next thing and here's the thing is that
most people just don't have that much
value to provide and so that last
transaction or the second sale or the
third sale depending on where their
value letter ends
that's where your value ladder ends only
when your ability to provide value
matches your price
so whenever i am someone who wants to do
these upsells and i want to be able to
provide more value
at this point you're basically saying
that the key thing to develop is not
necessarily that marketing or sales
skills but it's the ability to deliver
true genuine value and transformation
above and beyond anything you can charge
for easy easy to say hard to do yes
[Laughter]
yes i get so but at the same time like
wow when people understand this that
means this key skills that i develop is
just understanding more the people that
i'm serving and then delivering you know
systems or competence that actually can
solve the problems that they have in
their lives right yeah um and and to be

20
00:19:00.000 --> 00:20:00.000
able to develop that i know this
transition a bit into the grand slam
offer because i feel like the offer is
the way to at least communicate what
you're trying to solve
and i wanted to transition there because
we made that promise of telling a bit
more about it my question would be this
is that if i'm out there and i'm
basically i feel like i'm selling the
same thing as everybody else right and i
know we talk a lot about that in the
book um
what is the mistake that's happening
because a lot of people that say i'm
starting an agency maybe i'm a
consultant maybe i'm a coach
or maybe i'm in the workplace and i'm
working a job that's similar to
everybody else and i feel like the way
to you know excel is maybe to do just a
little more than everybody else at the
same price or maybe to be a little
cheaper than everybody else and provide
the same value but i know you look at
this very differently and you introduce
something fascinating around the grand
slam offer
so a saying that i have it's not in the
book but it's
marketing is about different business is
about better
and so
and you said a very key point is that
the offer is the way that we communicate
the value that we're going to deliver
right because we haven't delivered it

21
00:20:00.000 --> 00:21:00.000
yet we're just communicating the value
and so having a grand slam offer will
get tons of people to say yes to you
then the problem is delivering on the
promise right but those are for me i
would rather choose to have a delivery
problem than have a demand problem it's
much easier to fix a machine that's got
electricity going through it
rather than have a machine that has no
juice going through it and try and
speculate about what's wrong with it so
i'd rather figure out what does everyone
really want and then figure out a way to
deliver on it you know and one of the
ways you know the process that i take
people through the book is first off
you'll probably need to charge more than
you currently are number one number two
you probably need to have a less
scalable business model in the beginning
and that's okay because what we're doing
is you're going to get paid to do r d
right my less scalable business like and
so i'm i'm preaching a trajectory that i
followed right and it's also a
trajectory that i've seen so many other
uh you know very successful
entrepreneurs follow which is everyone
has this rocky cut scene that no one
talks about right these great marketers
spent four years cold calling doing

22
00:21:00.000 --> 00:22:00.000
door-to-door sales stuff that no one
talks about i spent i sold 4 000 gym
memberships before i ever taught anyone
how to sell right and so i knew what i
was talking about because i had done it
so many times but it wasn't it wasn't
very glorified at the moment right i was
just selling a lot but i didn't realize
that my work was working on me more than
i was working on it and so
the
the the the first step i just said right
you'll probably need to charge more than
you are the second is you probably need
to have some sort of done for you
component where you're going to provide
more than you normally would
and just go above and beyond
third is you want to solve every single
problem that your that your prospect has
and if you don't know what they are
that's why we do this really in depth
kind of chapter in your business career
like how did alex know how to fix so
many gyms so well well i spent two like
not only did i have my own six in
different locations but i turned around
33 of my own in black markets white
markets latino markets brits poor east
west uk
canada like we went all over the place
and i knew that okay in these markets
this is what we have to do a little
different and these markets they're a

23
00:22:00.000 --> 00:23:00.000
little bit like this and and i had to
learn all these little nuances but then
it just the tr the depth of the
knowledge the roots were so deep it was
really impossible to compare my
experience to anyone else's and so most
people just try and jump to like how do
i make the offer better when reality is
like how do i make me better so that
when i make my promise i know that i can
deliver on it right
and so
the the kind of last step of this is
like how do i how do i solve all the
problems which you know i put that
within the vehicle of the bonuses right
it's like how can i solve every single
problem or rather perceived problem that
the prospect is has or believes they
have
and then how do i how do i reverse all
risk to them right how can i make how
can i create an unbeatable guarantee and
my kind of thinking around the guarantee
is especially when you're starting out
you almost want to make a guarantee that
you're scared of
and i say that for two reasons one
because you'll sell more people two
because if you're scared of it then
you're going to work your ass off to try
and fulfill on it and i think that if
you raise that level of what you're
promising you just you'll it will force
you to level up because a lot of people

24
00:23:00.000 --> 00:24:00.000
sell like how to make money and i'm like
well what if you just guaranteed that
they make money
they're like well i couldn't do that i'm
like well why not that's the reason you
don't make money like that
that's why you're not making money
like the average the average you know in
our licensing
and just for everyone who knows like
that's one of seven businesses that
we're a part of it's it's that's kind of
how we started our journey as the
fitness and i tell more of those stories
because in some of the other companies i
was able to jump like five steps ahead
but like we kind of walk through every
one of these steps with that business
like the average gym that worked with us
added 240 000 a year in top line that's
average that was the average
you know the average gym uh 3.1 x their
profit they went from 29.50 a month and
take home to 8 900 a month and take them
net of our fees on top of what we what
we we build right and so if you have
that level of deliverable right on
average then you will make a lot of
money
and that's really what it comes down to
like like
like if you if you can deliver on a
promise and deliver something that's

25
00:24:00.000 --> 00:25:00.000
very valuable where people don't have to
have lots of effort and sacrifice which
gets into the value equation right which
i put inside the book
you will be rewarded by the marketplace
i i feel like if i'm uh if i'm one of
the people that has that pillar that
that stool pillar that's more around the
sales and marketing or the acquisition
of customer like what you've just
explained is a powerful way to at least
you know get the electricity in or get
the juice in which is make the sales
happen by doing an offer that just
really delivers on the problems you want
to solve or the perceived problem that
they know they want to get rid of
and then you're forced to deliver
because you've made those promises and
that's where you kind of you're able to
kind of like overcompensate for your
natural ability to sell to you know
force yourself to deliver something of
great value and then you grow those
skills and i know in your case you had
this done for you things that you've
developed over time and so for whoever's
in business it's basically a question of
like hey you're kind of you know
drinking water from a fire hydrant
because you went in and cracked it open
i wanted to see if you had an example on
the other side which is if i'm someone
who's a product entrepreneur and what
i've seen a lot of people say is like
i've created something amazing but i
just don't nobody wants to buy it nobody

26
00:25:00.000 --> 00:26:00.000
wants to to deal with it and i feel like
i'm like no one understands me better do
you have a would you approach it
similarly or would it be a different
approach if i'm a product first
entrepreneur oh that's great there's i
have so much to say on that um i'll try
it i'll try and keep it as short as
possible so i hear this one all the time
right my stuff is so good if only people
knew about it thing is people do know
about it it's your current customers and
they're not telling anyone so it's
probably not that good you think it's
good because you love it but they don't
think it's good which why they're not
telling you in fact they're ashamed of
telling people about who you are right
and so we have to ask the question why
are they not right and so i would say
it's a function of one of two things
either it's something that the
marketplace doesn't want as a whole
that's product market fit
or that you're just not that good at
delivering the thing that you sell
what happens most the time especially
with the promotional based entrepreneurs
like you're referencing earlier those
guys then they'll read the book and they
instantly make i've gotten so many
messages of guys being like dude i just
5x to my income this month holy cow you
know from for me in the book and i'm
like right the problem is like you still

27
00:26:00.000 --> 00:27:00.000
gotta deliver right and that's the
that's the that's the part that a lot of
people struggle with because most
promoters are not natural operators
and so
there's two ways you can really go about
this you can find i mean it's only one
way really ugh i guess there's two so in
theory you could become the jack of all
trades right you can learn how to
develop product how you can learn how to
develop customer experiences that are
exceptional all that kind of stuff right
or you can find someone else someone
else who who can do that right and so
that the path from 10 million to 100
million is people right so it goes
promotion
zero to one product one to ten people
ten to a hundred
and the people can either be in the form
of partners it can be in the form of of
high level talent that you recruit and
bring on board sometimes you have to
incent with a little bit of equity
sometimes you don't depends on the level
of the skill depends on the business
but if you're a product guy
most products are not most products suck
most products are not good enough you
know what i mean because if they were
exceptional then you wouldn't actually
have a customer issue

28
00:27:00.000 --> 00:28:00.000
that's the thing right and so it just
it's an easy scape like a scapegoat of
like i'm not successful because i'm not
one of these marketers it's like no
you're not successful because your
sucks like that's what it is
but it's okay
you have to and that's why going zero to
one is you still have to learn enough to
promote
so that you can fix the product so that
it can get to the point where it's not
so heavy on the promotion and then it's
ultimately a balanced business
ooh that's some that's some truth truth
bombs there in the bit of a reality
check a lot for people who might be in
this situation so alex thank you for the
extreme honesty on it i kind of wanted
to close on one thing that i found
interesting within the book within what
you say and the way that you
operate your business is a lot of times
you tell people like hey everything i
teach i don't want to charge for yet you
only deal with entrepreneurs over 3
million
i wanted you to share a bit more about
that mentality about why you do this and
what was so magic around the 3 million
mark
so um i put 3 million as the barrier but
candidly the smallest business that
we're working with is doing about 8
million
right now i just put it there so that if

29
00:28:00.000 --> 00:29:00.000
there's somebody who has something like
really interesting um i could i can see
it
and you know have the opportunity to
potentially you know participate and
help them
but i think
you know i'm fairly
transparent with my numbers and i think
i've been that way because i always
hated people who fronted and i had so
many times in my life where i was like
listening to this person and then all of
a sudden i found out that i was making
way more than them and i was like what
and they were just kind of fronting and
so i kind of made a rule with myself
that i always be pretty transparent
about my numbers
and so we like internally we operate
open books so
every every employee knows exactly how
much alex takes home and i'm fine with
that you know what i mean i mean shoot
it's on my youtube so i don't really
you know what i mean um so you know
we've taken home you know about 45
million in dividends you know from our
businesses over the last three or four
years and um
i don't have the desire to create a how
to make money online or how to have a
coaching business or how to build an
online business you know that that kind

30
00:29:00.000 --> 00:30:00.000
of world i just don't have the desire
for it and so
the thinking behind it was you know i
donate
you know all this money to charity we
donate probably a million bucks last two
years each year um and i was like well
you know what's more valuable than the
money right the most valuable thing i
can do the marketplace is give the
skills the experiences the beliefs that
i have to other entrepreneurs and so i
think i'll be able to have far more i
think the world will be a better place
if more entrepreneurs are better at
business because i don't think you know
i think we can all agree the
government's not coming to save us so
that was kind of like the overarching
thought process it's like okay if that's
the most valuable thing then is there a
way that i can supply that
at almost no marginal cost so that's why
i started the youtube channel that's why
i wrote the book and you know have the
other books that are on the way is that
there's almost no marginal cost of
distribution and so i didn't want to
build
like i said a coaching program any of
that kind of stuff and so i figured for
everybody who's under 3 million 5
million bucks a year you can just use
all the stuff you know and my goal was
to make it better than all the stuff
that's out there because we actually do
it rather than just making money saying

31
00:30:00.000 --> 00:31:00.000
that we do it
um
and then you know if there is a company
that that
executes all of those things they grow
their company you know past 3 million 5
million 10 million um and they want to
get to 30 million 50 million 100 million
etc then we would be able to participate
you know in an investor advisor
relationship and because at that point
they've already proven that they know
how to execute
and i've already proven to them that i
know how to provide value and so that
way it kind of operates off of shared
trust from the onset
because you know they're like dude i
read your first book in the second book
and i watched all these videos and we
went from you know 100 grand a month to
600 000 a month and
now what do i do and i'm like all right
well these are the things that we need
to do which and honestly most the
content the most the stuff that is there
i've made some content that would reply
to those people and um it it goes over
most people's heads not in a not in a um
like it's hard to understand it's just
not applicable right now
so i'm like all right guys this is how
we develop our compensation plans to lay
out our departments

32
00:31:00.000 --> 00:32:00.000
well you know if you're if you've got
six employees you're really not thinking
about that and so it's just not relevant
for most people and so it's that's why
all the stuff that's out there is really
like it'll get it'll get most business
to about a million bucks a month
that's incredible alex thank you so much
for spending this time with me and
sharing all these amazing insights for
those who are listening i think they're
left with feeling inspired because i
know i am there's something you've
created that's amazing i think there's a
lot of nuggets of information here that
we can take home for one it's just
understanding that yes there will be
struggles along the way because you're
trying to figure out your business
you're trying to figure out your product
and whatever plan you've initially set
up be okay with the fact that this might
change significantly but what i love the
most about what alex shared is
throughout this journey you're always
developing skills tools and modifying
your beliefs that actually make you
ready for the next step that's coming up
if there's anything that's limiting you
from selling knowing that how you can
divide your offer into a way that really
solves the problems for the people that
you're serving is how you're going to be
able to identify how to speak to them
and how to make what i thought was
really brilliant a guarantee that even
scares you a little bit that way you're

33
00:32:00.000 --> 00:33:00.000
putting your the risk on yourself and so
you're actually going out there with a
need to deliver and when you do that yes
you're going to be putting yourself a
bit more at risk but you'll deliver far
more than ever learn so much more
through the process and really get you
over the hump to really create something
of massive value alex has delivered
everything he's created in the fitness
industry and multiple other businesses
now which means that you can take this
you can apply it and of course like i've
mentioned at the beginning of this call
if you haven't picked up a copy of the
100 million dollar offer go and grab a
copy i will put a link in the show note
as well as well as all the educational
material that alex has online at
acquisition.com it's brilliant stuff
everyone and that's why i'm so happy i
had alex here on the call alex thank you
so much for your time and all your
sharing and
keep on your journey man i can't wait to
see you on that billionaire list and
looking jacked
can i offer one thing to the audience
about the selling thing you mentioned
so
when you make a crazy guarantee that
scares you
it
it transfers the trust that is required
from them trusting you to you trusting
you

34
00:33:00.000 --> 00:34:00.000
and so
if you don't want to have this crazy
guarantee it means that you don't trust
yourself and then fundamentally that is
why you are not making the money you
want to make because if you don't trust
you then why should they and so you're
asking other people to trust you when
you don't even trust you and so if you
make a crazy guarantee you can start by
just trusting yourself because that's
what the guarantee is about and then
over time
you can you can lengthen that after you
have a have a longer track record to
prove that they would have a reason to
trust you and they've gotten from
referrals and blah blah blah all that
kind of stuff but anyways i appreciate
you and then just you guys know for the
audience the book's 99 cents on amazon i
wanted to make it available for everyone
worldwide so you know in some countries
like india and and bangladesh you know a
20 25 book would is still you know like
a week's worth of income so 99 cents is
the lowest i could put it on amazon
so that it's available for everyone and
then on acquisition.com
there's a training area that you don't
have to opt in for anything the videos
are there downloads checklists all the
stuff kind of the internal saps of how
you actually create these offers on a

35
00:34:00.000 --> 00:35:00.000
consistent basis within your business or
product lines
incredible stuff and alex i love that
last statement because yeah i think we
expect a lot of trust from others and we
haven't done our self work and so i'm
excited to see people use this in a very
effective way i think it's great advice
so thank you again so much for
everything you've provided thank you for
having me appreciate it
i am your host jason mark campbell and
this is the selling with love podcast
