series yes
and ultimately you found fame you're in
layla's both because i've everyone's
heard your story that knows you
but for those that don't maybe know you
that are listening to this you guys were
broke
found each other and built a [ __ ] 150
million dollar
portfolio

2
00:01:00.000 --> 00:02:00.000
29
smarter than the [ __ ]
i don't even want to cuss because i want
this to be shared
smarter than a whip
both of them they know business it's
unbelievable if you guys ain't following
their content i'm telling you you better
and also
acquisition.com and i'm just going to
spill them out here just case someone
shuts this off real quick
acquisition.com now correct me if i'm
wrong
you're basically saying hey if you're
making three to ten million or more and
you want to scale that [ __ ] call us
that's exactly what it is and then
you'll either invest buy a piece buy the
whole thing you'll do a bunch of [ __ ]
like you're just getting deal flow like
it's going out of style aren't you it's
been going really well uh yeah we
actually just do minority partnerships
right now so we're always minority
stakes in the companies we don't take
majority at least for the next you know
few years
so do you guys just go in there and show
them how to do it it's a lot of i mean
it's mostly like nose and hands off on
most areas and then the area that we
involve ourselves in the most is
recruiting so we actually do a lot of

3
00:02:00.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the recruiting for their leadership
in-house just because we've seen that's
like probably where most people kind of
go wrong um but the rest of it's you
know
i mean we kind of do like the overall
company strategy then we go and you know
he does his pricing and packaging i do
the org review and organizational design
then we dive into functionals like sales
marketing finance so we try to do the
whole thing it's just a matter of like
we plan it out over the next three years
basically so we're like we get the
business more like how are we going to
triple this business in three years and
we lay out the plan for that and then we
give it to them on the first day that we
kind of kick off with them we're like
this is what we're gonna do
okay so now how did you guys go from
broke
in love
to to rich and genius
the
the short story was uh we met
uh on bumble i met later on our first
date after she tried not to go on the
first date with me um and uh within you
know pretty quickly i just realized i
really liked her we talked for four
hours just about business didn't talk
about anything that was not business and
money related and i was like man this
[ __ ] is interesting

4
00:03:00.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and so um we ended up just hanging out
every day after that um and i was like
hey i'm gonna start this gym launch
thing so i had six gyms at the time i
fought five rooms at the time i was like
i'm gonna start this thing where i like
flats gyms do these turnarounds i think
there's like somebody made there she was
like all right cool
so uh but i was like no what were you
doing at this point
i was in person and online personal
training so i had like basically built
up a big roth start like a 24 hour night
you were getting people in shape yeah it
was just like super transactional yeah i
was i mean not that we met through
bumble the dating app yeah like she
looked fit on her thing and i was into
fitness and said made sense yeah living
in the same town or no yeah
uh newport beach all right so so you met
on bumble and then what you were online
training and yeah i was doing online in
person and i was kind of trying to
figure out because i knew that i wanted
to either own a gym next or make an
online training business i have two
people kind of you know proposing
partnerships ish on each side um and
then i met alex and i told him that i
think like the second date or something
and he was like

5
00:04:00.000 --> 00:05:00.000
he's like you should not do either of
those he's like you'll make way more
money if you do something with me and i
was like
dude i don't even know you not untrue
and he was like i know he's like but
even if this didn't work out you know
romantically he's like i really think we
could make a ton of money together and i
was super career oriented that time so i
was like i mean [ __ ] i'm like 23. what
do i have to lose if it doesn't work out
so so he recruited you basically 100
yeah and see how did you know to recruit
her what what was she displaying so she
was number one sales rep for all of
orange county at 24 hour which is the
biggest chain you know i mean in
california so the fact that she was 23
and she was the number one sales rep i
was like all right if she can sell
then we can make money together because
i already you know i already knew the
marketing side so i was like i see
people who can close because if i can i
can get all the leads we need and so
that was that was how i knew that she
was good but then everything else she
was talking about she i could tell that
she was either interested or really knew
the things that she was talking about
and i didn't have anybody to help me
with uh gym launch which was going to be
the new company um and so i pitched her

6
00:05:00.000 --> 00:06:00.000
on the idea and she said no
just just for the listeners gym launch
you basically do what so gym watch for
the first just under two years was a
turnaround business so we used to fly
out to gyms in person i turn on the
marketing and we'd sit at the front desk
and fill the gym up with sales and
usually in under 30 days now would the
owners just ship themselves yes yeah
because because they don't know how to
do this right that's what we didn't know
though so we're like this is amazing
we're giving you so many clients and
they call me like what the [ __ ]
what do you mean
why would they be mad
they would get mad because typically if
somebody's coming to you because they're
struggling it's because they usually
don't have a very good product very very
good team to begin with and so we'd then
just
turn a 10 out of 10 marketing solution
onto a mediocre-ish product
and blow way more capacity so let's say
you have a crossfit gym that's got 70
members
30 days later they have 270 members so
we just tripled how many people are

7
00:06:00.000 --> 00:07:00.000
quadrupled how many people they were
handling in 30 days so they didn't have
the time to build the infrastructure the
team any of that stuff and so we just
blew the blue the roof off the things
and uh you know for us since we were
incentivized just to offer cash we were
just like we tried to sell as many
people as we possibly could in that
period of time but for them at some
point they were like hey man stop
selling so i'm like dude i gotta cover
hotels like i could airfare like i'm
we're gonna keep selling through the
entire 30 days that we said uh that
started to create some sort of
contention there and then also the
average selling too much yeah dude it
was
yeah the average would make 30 000 a
year on average that's what they take
home and so they'd see these kids 23 and
26 flying in and ripping a hundred grand
out of their gym in 30 days they're like
[ __ ] these people
and so that was like part of the issue
earlier on yeah it was bad like there
was one time i don't know why though see
see i'm in the rev share game and
there's a lot of small-minded thinkers
out there i don't want to rip share with
him why would you rather make a million
on your own than three million with me
just so you don't have to give me any
something that keeps you small it sounds
like the gym business was the same way

8
00:07:00.000 --> 00:08:00.000
they were getting pissed because they're
watching two kids rip a hundred g's out
of their facility plus they're probably
watching what you were doing and they
think oh i can do it myself now
semi yeah
so did you did you develop this
marketing uh
plan with your own with my gyms and work
there so what what was the plan
so we would run we run free offers on
the front end usually free challenges um
and then people come in and then we'd
sell them a version of a paid program
and then you know two days later they'd
come in and we'd sell them two or three
hundred dollars in supplements and so
we'd make you know six to nine hundred
dollars in the first 30 days for a new a
new new client and that was our deal so
we kept the upfront cash for the first
program they'd set up for and then
everything they did after that was the
gym so that was kind of the split we'd
we keep that from cash and then if they
convert into members you get everything
else which which is funny because
all the upfront is the cash after that
it's nine bucks a month it seems that we
were working with like 200 bucks a month

9
00:08:00.000 --> 00:09:00.000
so for them like you know it was because
they were um they were services but
still you tripled their business yeah
how can anyone be pissed at that most of
them are awful if you guys said to me
right now brad we'll take i'll i'll take
light speed and triple triple its
business but i want a
upfront chunk or whatever it is i'd be
like
all right
why wouldn't anyone do that i think it's
you know it's like it's a lot of them
are small for reasons and then they also
it's like they don't have the skills to
retain the client so it's like until
you've had to acquire 200 clients on
your own you don't really haven't given
yourself the time to acquire the skills
of how to service those clients so we
brought them all in and like there was
one time where i was in the gym in
hawaii which i'm pretty sure he forbid
me from coming back to the gym um
and i sold like 260 people in 30 days
and i was like doing pitches like
there'd be 10 people in a room because
why everyone brings their friends
they're like i would like have an
appointment with two people and then i
was like dude why are there 11 people in
here like well i brought my family like
it sounds like an amazing deal and i was
like this is insane um so i'd be doing
like snowball oh yeah it was amazing

10
00:09:00.000 --> 00:10:00.000
it was insane but you know like they
came in one day i'll never forget like
this trainer oh her name was like stacy
or something probably shouldn't say it
um and she walked in and she was like
you need to evan stop and i was like why
she's like i don't want to service
anyone else in this gym and i had all
these people sitting there and i was
like
you know leave and then she left and i
was like don't listen to stacey she's a
little stressed right now he's like
we're gonna change your life
but like it was crazy i mean they were
yeah i mean that's why we ended up
switching the model we were like we
can't keep selling people into the gyms
we have to teach people how to do this
for themselves and then teach them all
the other skills to retain the clients
yeah
so because at the end of the day like
the you know some of the members were
you know their lives are improving some
of the gym owners their lives were
improving but there was a lot of like
inefficiency like there's tons of people
who were signing up for weight loss
challenges and had a terrible experience
at the gym and there were some tons of
gym owners who had bad experiences with
us because we just blew them just blew
the roof off the place like it was
beyond what would have been helpful and
then they had to deal with like all the
negativity of like having overfilled
classes and you can't accommodate the

11
00:10:00.000 --> 00:11:00.000
people and all that kind of stuff and so
that's when we switched to uh teaching
people how to do it and then that way
they could throttle the volume based on
whatever they wanted to do and so that's
when we switched from in-person
turnaround business to the licensing
model and that's when everything like
really really took off because we could
only do you know at our peak we were
doing eight facilities a month so we had
uh you know eight sales guys they'd fly
out and they'd do the same model for
each of these gyms that was the peak and
i was like maybe 300 grand a month um
but once we switched to the licensing
within six months we were doing you know
two million a month and it was just a
different game
and when that doe started rolling in you
didn't run out and get cars and a bunch
of sexy houses
you guys just stayed like in a
one-bedroom apartment with a volkswagen
or some [ __ ] yeah
with a crack in the windshield
we pulled up to our mastermind and
somebody's like oh you guys were
supposed to be successful
you know it was just like we're so young
and we were terrified like i didn't even
want to touch the money you know what
happened is we literally got to a point
where the guy from chase called us and

12
00:11:00.000 --> 00:12:00.000
he was like layla and i was like what
he's like there's nine million in your
checking account for your business and i
was like yeah
it's fine just leave it there he's like
i can't leave you here it's not good to
keep this in here you need to take it
out and put a different account i was
like
like we were so terrified we're like
didn't know what to do with the money i
didn't know how to move the money he
didn't know what to do at investigation
she like should have called me
[Applause]
like
it looks like frugality now but it was
mostly fear you know i mean it was just
we just didn't want to mess anything up
and we did and you know when we started
gymlodge and it started blowing up i
just told when i was like i think we got
18 months i was like i don't know how
long this is going to last
like we might saturate every market
really fast and then it's going to
disappear
um that ended up not being the case but
like i was 100 percent hellbent on like
we got a year and a half so let's we're
going to not spend anything and we're
going to just plow all the cash into our
bank account so that we can hopefully
like have breathing room yeah and that
was what a lot of like mentors told us
early on you know we got invited to this
mastermind where's all people doing
eight figures and we had just started
making like 300 grand from the two of us
with an ea from like our kitchen table
and we went there and they were
basically like dude when it feels this

13
00:12:00.000 --> 00:13:00.000
easy you need to hit the gas because all
the dudes are bigger than you they're
gonna see what you're doing and they're
gonna take your [ __ ] we were like dude
we don't want that like this is finally
starting to work and so we just went all
in like absolute just 10 out of 10 work
mode yeah we didn't i mean we actually
after we went to that meeting
we sat down and basically wrote down all
the things that we were willing to give
up so we're like we're not drinking
anymore we're not seeing friends anymore
we're not going out anymore we're not
doing vacations we're not doing weekends
i like that was it and so
basically from then and so that was did
you like that plan
yeah i i was the same
yeah
because it might have been difficult it
may have been a different story when
you've not been on that page yeah and i
think a lot of you know it's it's not
common i think for either person just be
like let's sacrifice everything to do
this but i think when we both met we're
both at that point we just really wanted
to succeed at something yeah so it
worked yeah we were both willing to just
we were both willing to take short-term
sacrifice for an extended period it was

14
00:13:00.000 --> 00:14:00.000
about three years two and a half three
years that we'd we didn't do we didn't
drink we didn't go out we really didn't
see friends ryan moran from
capitalism.com he jokes about it because
he like met us in austin because we
somebody connected us and he's like hey
so what do you guys want to hang out and
we're like really do that he was like
what
i was like yeah just i appreciate you
sounding awesome like we're just really
doing what we're doing right now and i
texted him like 18 months later i was
like hey man layla and i have decided
that we are we are seeing friends now so
if you'd like to have dinner i'm open
he's like this is the weirdest text i've
ever seen
that's what i mean by you guys like you
guys are like freaking almost robotic
and and when it comes to like
intelligence and logic i would say that
you guys got the majority of it when it
was doled out
yeah i don't know if that's true but
maybe alex more than me um yeah because
you figured it out for yourselves but
then you went and figured it out for a
bunch of other people now you're
basically getting equity in companies to
basically go in and fix companies
i just don't you know it's fine though
because like we were talking about today

15
00:14:00.000 --> 00:15:00.000
i'm like business is not that hard being
like a rocket scientist or like a
biochemist like that is hard but
business is like
listen listen listen okay well then help
me out here okay because i'm pretty good
at business i think
as far as the vision goes meaning
if we did this we'd make zillions but
then i can't get that to happen
so how do you get the people to execute
like you said you have this guy or that
guy i try to get people and i say hey
let's do this and then i just can't seem
to get it there like sometimes i say we
need a new website like our website
needs to say this and do this and you
know
two years goes by there's still a
website that does that
and i'm like
what do i do
how do you execute well it's i mean the
reason that so there's like the strategy
right you have the vision of like okay
if we're trying to maximize enterprise
value if we just do these two things we
can 10x the value of the business so
there's agreement with that cool so we
get agreement on that big picture thing
and then usually there's skill sets

16
00:15:00.000 --> 00:16:00.000
missing on the team
and so that's why the only thing that we
really do in-house is we recruit because
well could you can you
let me pay you to recruit
you want someone to be able to hang out
with you right
always like when you guys got that kind
of loot pretty soon you're going to be
just like you know where at oh we're in
greece
we just love we're running it from
greece you guys never been to greece we
haven't
no you don't travel either not much no
we travel in the us yeah we're doing
more speaking stuff yeah i'm going to
give you guys a nickname the lady in the
lumberjack
oh my god it's going to be the podcast
title now
the lady in the lumberjack you guys are
just like down to earth as it gets it
just blows my mind like you you bought a
bentley because i said come on spend
some money then you bought it and you're
like ah let's say if i can it doesn't
pay off or what did you say i was just
wasting my not my speeds yeah you know

17
00:16:00.000 --> 00:17:00.000
the you know
roi or some [ __ ] like i heard your story
marginal return on like the money spent
there i just don't get the same amount
if i were to just you don't like to go
and sit in a badass car
not really
now like like the gym equipment that i
have i spent a lot of money on that i
would say like you know it's like a
hundred fifty thousand on a home gym
like that's a lot of money you know andy
fursela yeah good dude
go check out his freaking home gym go
check out the go check out his
headquarters
in like five days
that's the dumbest [ __ ] ever
you guys are going to be fast friends
number one emily's cool as [ __ ] she's
like the new martha stewart we've heard
they're awesome everyone's told me that
they're like you emily need to meet yeah
andy's and andy's like the real deal
when you like if if he takes you to his
home and and let you see like under the
hood yeah that dude's got some kick ass
[ __ ] like he i had no idea the first
form was as big as it actually is
super big or the influence that andy

18
00:17:00.000 --> 00:18:00.000
actually has yeah
the thing that it's like for andy though
like he loves cars and i feel like
that's like real for him and so like if
i were if we were to get a car like a
bentley or something it wouldn't be for
us it would be like to look a certain
way because we don't it's not it's not
you don't like leather i mean there's
leather teslas you know i mean there's
leather you know neither of us have
cared about cars driving right now tesla
yeah
it was the plaid
i got like a used it's the base model
use base model the roi on the upgraded
level didn't didn't really make sense
it's an input output kind of thing yeah
well i like nice clothes and like bags
and shoes and stuff so like we don't
it's not like like i like that stuff
i've always liked stuff like that so
like i don't know
[Music]
i think it's like digital real estate oh
yeah i mean i like it and it's also i
mean like you get you get a brand and

19
00:18:00.000 --> 00:19:00.000
it's easy to remember because like it's
funny because uh one of my one of the
guys in the building is a tech guy and
he was looking up the the stuff for
acquisition.com he was like dude 80 of
your traffic is from hand keyed in
people so people like type in
acquisition.com he's like that's insane
he's like
no one types in urls anymore i was like
well it's easy to remember maybe
i didn't i didn't know that when we got
it but i was like oh okay well that's
neat you know good to know and so i
think sometimes there is like real roi
on an easier simpler shorter domain that
people can order longer yeah
think about think about phrases
dude i got i own get that [ __ ]
on the phone
i'm serious
get that [ __ ] on the phone dot
com like that that could that could be
something oh my god i've also got um
you better know his name.com
you better know his name because what
this is one time i started looking about
the name of jesus and that's not his
name
and so like
you better know his name there you
go.com

20
00:19:00.000 --> 00:20:00.000
but you know i just keep them why not i
got i got nightmare employees
well dude i wanted to start like a
freaking uh yelp or a green door or
whatever for [ __ ] business owners
because these because this glass door
[ __ ] you should go read my glass door
reviews by the way because i comment on
all of them it's hilarious
but but it's just i think you know
there's some nightmare employees and i
think other employers would benefit from
knowing
alex hormozy's a piece of [ __ ] he
[ __ ] sued the last three companies he
worked for he's always got some sort of
illness
yeah
that's great
right so now you go to apply for a job
and guess what there's a credit rating
on your ass from employers
they run the car fax on the employee
it's called nightmare employees.com
some businesses just anybody want to
launch that hey you want to acquire
that one
let's do 3 million or more
see but i already i already think i

21
00:20:00.000 --> 00:21:00.000
figured you two out with the acquisition
thing so it's just deal flow
and all the deal flow comes in you guys
just look can we do something with these
guys yeah we could probably quadruple
that [ __ ] all right let's make a deal
can we do something with these guys
it's that simple well i would say
actually the only thing is like there's
a ton of businesses that are like really
appealing but then you meet the founder
or the ceo and you're like dude is that
what happened with lightspeed
you guys were like hey dude he ain't
coachable right he ain't coachable
he'll blow all the money
i mean bigger companies are harder but
i'm also different i'm a different
animal i'd give you the whole shebang
i'd say hey i won't be spending any
money i feel like i'm getting sold
i came here to get sold no i'll go home
and just look at my watch for three
months because when you guys walked in
here if you could execute even half the
[ __ ] i need executed
this place would be worth hundreds of
millions if not billions of dollars
like it's unbelievable what this place
could do the untapped potential

22
00:21:00.000 --> 00:22:00.000
unbelievable and if you guys walked in
here you'd be like well they're not
marketing
oh well let's start that bam
and all of a sudden i'll be like holy
[ __ ] how'd you do that
you marketed how important do you think
marketing is
if a small business is running
half a million dollars a month
and they want to triple it yeah would
marketing have something to do with it
depends so if so if you think about like
a car like how important is the wheel to
the car how important is the engine of
the car like they all have to be there
in order for the car to run and so but
from that that is a whole system has to
work together from a business
perspective i think that their sequence
of importance so like when you're at
zero you got to sell something to
someone someone period like that's what
that's how you have to make money once
you get to like usually 250 000 a month
ish you know 200 to 400 500
is usually at that point they've learned
some level of marketing to get there
and they think that they should market
more to get to the next level and
oftentimes that's not the case

23
00:22:00.000 --> 00:23:00.000
yeah and let's explain
i mean
most of the times when they come in you
know they think they need more marketing
and that's why i think they're attracted
to us because acquisition.com and alex
is known for being great with marketing
and acquisition and pricing and offers
but they come in and the reason that
they're not getting to where they want
to go is the lifetime value of those
customers is so low because they have
the marketing in place but they have
literally terrible fulfillment they
don't have a backend their team is
not experienced and so
what's the point in pushing more through
leaky bucket and so we fix the bucket
first and then we'll blow marketing
through and that's worked really well
for our companies thus far i mean
they're all
how do you how do you
uh
fix leaky bucket how long would it take
you to fix a budget
how long does it take you to assess the
leaks in the bucket
that doesn't take that long that doesn't
take that long maybe a few weeks maybe
maybe
four to six weeks yeah
and then you got the leaky bucket
down and now you just fill it fix it
yeah and that takes longer because a lot
of the times i mean with companies that
between three and ten it's not nearly as
hard and that's why we like that size

24
00:23:00.000 --> 00:24:00.000
because you're basically putting things
in place that don't exist if i take a
company like yours or company that's
doing between 20 and 50 million they
have leaky buckets that have been there
for years and so it's ingrained
with the whole team and there's usually
but what if you had
unbridled
kill myself
i mean we don't run the companies yeah i
know you guys are just advising yeah
you're collecting equity left and right
bank bank bank yeah like in 10 years you
guys are probably the first well there's
a trillion there now isn't there i don't
know
you guys might be the world's first one
you guys might be the world's first
trillionaires
i don't know about that what's funny is
you'll have it all in the bank
sitting there we'll just stare at it
yeah obviously you've got a car yet
you'll be like nope still got my old
truck
that tesla's still cranking
yeah you guys make it look easy sound
easy it pisses me off a little bit
because like i'm sitting on a billion
dollar deal and i can't get freaking a

25
00:24:00.000 --> 00:25:00.000
website designed i think you just need
i'm an executor i need a recruiter yeah
you need you need the one person next to
you who does everything for you like you
need your like number your first you're
like well can you recruit me one
i mean
no but yes in theory you can recruit one
but i mean that's what most people are
missing is like you've got someone like
yourself or someone like alex who's like
this amazing visionary somebody's got
all these great ideas but like you just
don't have that one person that could be
your go-to who's the filter for the rest
of the company that's going to make it
all happen and that's what most people
are lacking and a lot of people have
somebody there but they're resentful of
the fact that you don't do as much right
because in their mind oh you're all
thinking all day doing podcasts and
[ __ ] like you see a lot of that or
they don't have the ability to execute
because they have no ability to
influence the rest of the team they get
someone who's really good at systems and
processes and sops but they're not a
leader and so they can't lead a team and
they can't even recruit higher level
talent that you need because they
themselves are not high left high enough
level talent and so it's like that's
often the bottom line for a company like
yours or a lot of the ones that come in

26
00:25:00.000 --> 00:26:00.000
is they just don't have that person and
they underestimate the importance of it
yeah
because like how good i am is going to
dictate how much we can bring his vision
to life
so let's pretend you guys took over
today
let's pretend you took over light speed
today what would be the first hood you
want to look under we probably simplify
well we look at all past sales we look
at what what we look at the offer suite
that's typically the the first place
that i want to say is a mess but is one
of the easiest biggest levers that we
can pull in the business so it's let's
look at all the customers who bought
let's look at the price points in the
packages that were sold to them can we
bucket these into two to three things
that that really make up the
bulk of the purchases and then what are
the gross margins associated with those
things and so it's like okay well we've
got this product over here that has tons
of margin a lot of people are buying but
like we're not really pushing it very
much like huh that's underutilized we've
got this other thing that's this big
service heavy
thing like well screw that that has
terrible margins and it's hard to find
customers so we configure it usually

27
00:26:00.000 --> 00:27:00.000
into a much simpler product suite which
makes it easier for the sales guy to
sell makes it easier for the marketing
team to message around and then
operationally it makes it easier for the
business to scale because if we only
have a few things we have to do it's
easier to do a few things with a lot of
volume than lots of things with lots of
volume and so we'll fix that part
usually first and that's usually like
the lightest easiest thing we can do and
then we look at the experience around
around the products which is usually
more of the back end which is like
customer success customer experience you
know what do we do like if there's a
recurring element how do we reduce churn
you know are there other activation
points that we can start measuring uh
can we decrease time to value which is a
huge one you know a lot of times like as
simple examples
like weight loss because everybody
understands that if if you have a weight
loss program if you can help someone
lose like 10 pounds in the first 14 days
the likely that they'll actually stick
with it for the long haul is much higher
because of the emotional victory then
they think oh this actually works even
if you change the strategy from the
first 14 days to the rest of the time
you say listen
i showed you that i know what i'm doing
now we need to go into the slow gradual

28
00:27:00.000 --> 00:28:00.000
phase you're good you're in good hands
and so it's kind of the same thing with
like business stuff it's like if we can
compress the time to value then people
buy into the process of whatever our
solution is and then you get way longer
stick rates they feel like they can
justify the price more easily they don't
get cold feet
and so that's usually when we start
fixing these things back to front and
usually when we think in terms of
tripling companies we think in two
triples so most of the time we can
triple the company without actually
increasing the marketing for the first
triple
just because of i'll give you a
different example so we have um
two businesses that are in the same
industry um within our portfolio and
the cost of acquisition and i happen to
know a lot about the industry um the
threat the cost of acquisition is within
a very narrow range between all
companies in that space but the
difference between the massive companies
and the small companies is not the cost
of acquisition that's what everyone
focuses on they're like i got to get
better ads i get it you got to increase
our closing percentage and sure you
should but those are incremental things
but we can triple or 5x the value of the
customer then all of a sudden we can

29
00:28:00.000 --> 00:29:00.000
start marketing on 20 channels we can
10x our ad spend because our return is
there now whereas most guys will they'll
have bigger margins in the beginning
they'll increase their ad spend and then
they'll get to this point where they're
doing more revenue but their margins get
compressed because the thing that
they're selling they don't
they haven't fixed the backing yet and
then that's what ends up hitting their
cap and then they stay there and that's
usually when we end up that's usually a
lot of times when we end up working with
companies
so how did you guys learn it though just
by doing it
i think so i mean we've done it together
you know jim launch prestige allen and
now acquisition.com and then we started
working you know two years ago with a
handful of companies to see if we could
do it with other people's companies you
know and then we were able to outsource
gym launch and prestige and alan to we
got those to the point where they could
sell which meant that we had to get
people to be leaders and we turned into
the board so we've gone through the full
cycle enough times it's like you see the
patterns that's all it is experience is
pattern recognition so it's just
recognizing the patterns that have
happened each time being like ah i see
like that's a thing in every company not

30
00:29:00.000 --> 00:30:00.000
just mine another one of those yeah
you guys should start a consulting firm
because it's cool because this way it's
like we're long-term partners with these
companies and you know transparently if
we take something from essentially
having no value because a lot of times
you know a 3 million top line business
maybe makes a million bucks in profit
and a very heavily involved founder with
very little support which is pretty
common i mean that's the smallest type
company but just as an example like
there's not a lot of enterprise value
there like no one's gonna actually buy a
hundred percent of that company if the
founder walks like it doesn't doesn't
make sense and so unless there's systems
and processes
then there's still to be some talent on
the team to run that that playbook you
know what i mean not a lot of people
want to buy like an empty warehouse
essentially yeah and so
we know that we're going to take
something from close to zero in value
even if it's two million bucks whatever
close to zero in value and then we know
that in you know three to five years
this thing's worth 50.
like there's no consulting fee that
makes sense you know what i mean it just
doesn't like that's why that model

31
00:30:00.000 --> 00:31:00.000
doesn't work for what we're doing i mean
i mean people could do it it's just not
what we would want to do we don't like
the transactional
nature of consulting yeah like project
based people like can i pay you for now
i'm like no it just feels gross yeah
nothing wrong with it people who like it
well again fortunately you don't have to
make your living that way right
that's what makes that's what it's
almost like the takeaway close
yeah like you not willing to do it it
makes you more people even want you to
do it
maybe like there's people listening to
the show right now going i'll get them
to do it
oh
you guys have
i would say nine figures sitting around
and you ain't spending it much you're
investing it most all of it right what
is your goal with that
well i have short-term goals alex has
more money goals than me so yeah i have
more money goals than layla does um i
want to get laila on the self-made
women's list on forbes so i think it's

32
00:31:00.000 --> 00:32:00.000
top 50 self-made women's to the bottom
and that's 250. so just gonna hit that
one that'll be the first one and then um
and then you know maybe i can
slowly work my way up to the men's list
it's a lot harder to get what is do you
know the men's list i think it's like
two or three billion
yeah
like a billion doesn't like i guess
billionaire would be the next level
because at least that that's a threat i
think a billionaire is the new
millionaire sorry billionaires
i don't disagree
like when i was a kid i always dreamt of
being a millionaire thinking a
millionaire was a billionaire yeah you
know i didn't realize and maybe back
then it still wasn't the case i don't
believe but a million dollars wasn't
really that much money
even then yeah yeah 100 000 a year was
my goal
because when you think millionaire as a
as a normal person yeah
you're thinking extravagance and
you know at least deca millionaire level
stuff
you're not realizing like that's barely

33
00:32:00.000 --> 00:33:00.000
enough to like really do anything
yeah and i don't think that you you can
at that time predict like the amount of
overhead that you're also going to
accumulate so the amount of risk that
you have to lose how much of that
million with trying to move forward and
make more than a million is like you're
gonna lose money trying to make more
money so it's yeah and people don't
think about that yeah you lose you lose
millions to make deck of millions yeah
by the way by the way i would have been
drop bombs the whole time
if if we were dropping bombs so don't
don't think i forgot it's just there'd
be too many out of them
[Music]
i can't hear anything
so does it feel good when you wake up in
the morning obviously to where you can
pretty much do whatever you want what
couldn't you do right now
i think it's not what you can't do but
like
based on our goals what we have
restricted ourselves to to achieve those
goals so like
going on a lot of vacations right now
taking a lot more time with friends
doing a lot of things like at our
leisure you know waking up and be like i
don't feel like doing anything today

34
00:33:00.000 --> 00:34:00.000
like that's not how it's working right
now at all so it's very much like we're
in the middle of building acquisition
not like we're building all these
businesses but at the same time we're
building our team at acquisition.com
it's not just me and alex you know we
have
really
talented high-level people that are on
that team so that we can expand our
portfolio without losing quality in
terms of our service and like how much
we can help them yeah and so are you
finding these people
all over the place i mean you know
there's referrals there's linkedin
there's you know scraping lists from you
know harvard or mckinsey or you know
whatever and finding people that just
recently graduated or work at a place um
and just outbound and so most of it's
outbound there's not much inbound what
is your
weight on a degree
uh
not a ton i think
i think what i like is to have a healthy
mix of people that have institutional
knowledge versus in the trenches
knowledge so people have been there done
that and they've built businesses or
they've been you know say the vp of
sales for something that's gone from you
know 5 million to 50 million or 100
million and then there's people who have

35
00:34:00.000 --> 00:35:00.000
you know done uh consulting at mckinsey
and they've worked with companies
between 50 and a billion right and so i
think each of them have a different kind
of knowledge i think that i look at it
more as not the knowledge that that one
person has but like the collective
knowledge of the team and the collected
like the diversity and thinking that we
get in that one team so i don't care
about like whatever diversity you have i
think diversity of thinking which is
like different perspectives what i think
is really great about the team we have
now is that everyone can argue like we
have constantly arguing with each other
we have conflicting points of views and
we yet we have the same values and we
understand the mission and it's because
everyone's really smart and talented
they just have different experience and
so that allows us to come to better
conclusions than we would if we were all
thinking the same way we all had the
same experience we all kind of looked
and dressed the same way like our team
is very different in terms like you look
at all of us and we're like we don't
look like each other we don't dress like
each other like it's great eclectic
fit
yeah i would say everyone's got their
own styles you know yeah it's diverse
are you guys wordsmiths
what does that even mean you look up

36
00:35:00.000 --> 00:36:00.000
words just so you have a much broader
vocabulary i don't no i look at words
every day i make up words on accident i
look up words every day too because i
like knowing them i like looking up
normal words
like which one what is a lead
it's a meadow right
like like a lead everyone's talking
about like oh it leads yeah i thought
you said
i was gonna say like dude that's that's
a deep one but you know
it's a [ __ ] meadow yeah so less like
less like vocabulary more just defining
terms i feel like i spent a lot of time
on that a lot is that where you get your
framework abilities
i think it's um i'm going to start
mimicking your framework abilities i'd i
would love it if more people made
framework
if everybody wants the secret to social
media guys i'm telling you just go look
at their social media and realize that
all that [ __ ] is intentional there's
nothing there's no play going on they
are freaking 100
you guys are machines like you both have
it coming out left and right bang bang

37
00:36:00.000 --> 00:37:00.000
which means you're sitting around
for hours at a time
telling the camera
frameworks
and and thoughts and opinions you're
more thoughts and opinions he's more
framework but you both kind of do
frameworks do you guys collaborate on
who's going to do what
we tend to i mean like the more we've
spoken together and also because we've
brought all the companies together like
we tend to know what the other like i
have a good idea what i was probably
going to say or what angle she's going
to kind of cover on a question and she
probably has a pretty good idea of like
what angle or you know approach i'm
going to have on a question and so
usually kind of like it's taking time to
not you know i'd over talk or show them
you know like we've learned that dynamic
how did you guys learn to do all this
did you hire experts because you just
like for example your podcast like this
is my podcast i accidentally am in the
higher rankings i don't know why
if i were to do what you do i would be
way higher in the rankings
like you know
in the beginning this podcast is brought
to you by by the way go here go there

38
00:37:00.000 --> 00:38:00.000
like i don't do any of that [ __ ]
and that's basic 101 smart things to do
i don't think so though i mean like
everything that i've seen that actually
like people like your story is not
uncommon there's so many people like
alex's book it wasn't there's no
optimization to get this book to like
sell or blow up same with his pocketbook
but that book was good everybody
your podcast is good by the way 100
million dollar offer or 100m
offers there's a sequence coming out
after that are they out yet no i'm
working on leads which is the next see
that's what i mean by methodical like
you didn't just write a book you already
knew the four you were gonna write
before you wrote any of them you already
have this master plan
and all those books lead somewhere i'm
telling you
they all they're all
they're all strategic they are all exact
i guarantee you that 100 million offer
that's a good one but people like that
book you know when people start liking
books and you know it goes around you
can sell quite a few how many of you
sold 200 000 holy [ __ ] see my book i
sold like 12 000.
yeah it was like not easy either took

39
00:38:00.000 --> 00:39:00.000
like a year
and a half but i didn't call anybody and
say hey can you send this to your list i
didn't do anything uh yeah intelligent i
would say
well you know what's like what you were
saying about like does a business need
marketing right like
theoretically the best market in like
this sounds old but like the best
marketing is a really good product and
so
like
i like the reason i think the reason
this podcast is involved because like
it's a good product you know i mean
people talk about it and if you think
about how to how to market in general
like how do people tell other people
about stuff right that's what it means
and so
most of times you have input to output
in terms of like i put in a phone call i
put i put in the input of a post i make
a video like there's inputs and then
there's outputs and i might add money to
that to get even more output but all of
those are still linear equations so it's
like i put in a dollar i get 10 right it
could be the same for advertising it'd
be the same i put in 10 phone calls i'll
get one whatever it is but the only one
that's quadratic so exponential in
nature is word of mouth one person tells
two two people tell four four people so
eight and so like that's where i think

40
00:39:00.000 --> 00:40:00.000
um
that's why i think the magic explodes is
when the product is really exceptional
which is which is what you're touching
on in your podcast when you say like at
the end you say if you found any value
in this uh tell your buddies
it's like but it's just like i i'm
listening to him like i should be doing
that i should be doing that i should be
doing that and you do it quick and easy
and it's almost nonchalant like you're
not even doing it
honestly that was caleb's wreck i mean
we we knocked down
370 episodes before i had a single like
oh yeah by the way i have other things
that you can check out if you want so
like you know i think we just we're i
think we're big on like just get going
and it's better to get going and then
learn along the way then to just try and
make it perfect and just get value like
if you give value like we just know that
goodwill accumulates people will tell
their friends about it like we're not so
worried about like asking like if
somebody really wants to know how to buy
something from you they'll google your
freaking name you know what i mean and
then they'll figure out what you sell
and like we don't actually sell anything
but like

41
00:40:00.000 --> 00:41:00.000
people will find other things they can
consume from us yeah well number one the
youtube channel where is that
search my name it'll alexormosi.com up
did you go did you go get alex
hormozy.tv
no but i have alex from rosie.com i
should probably buy it before this uh
before the series
well you should get that one because
when people say well what's your youtube
channel i just say bradley.tv yeah let's
go there it just
one hand on the camera
um
but yeah you get you give a lot of
framework a lot of value there you don't
have a podcast or are you just on his uh
no i'm not even on his i'm starting one
i think in like
maybe six weeks we're starting mine um
but it's just gonna be a little
different it's gonna be about scaling
specifically
so are you are you like
when it comes to business when you guys
attack
one does something someone does
something else what what is it that you
do it's i would actually just from uh
how you visualize it we both do the same
thing we do different aspects of it so

42
00:41:00.000 --> 00:42:00.000
it's like this is the plan we both agree
to and so i'm gonna say like this is
what the product suite needs to be this
is what the you know maybe the
experience needs to look like et cetera
and then layla's like who needs to do
this what type of team needs to exist
what is the communication cadence of the
company to make this happen see that's
exactly what i need here yeah i know
yeah
i need a layla right now i think it's
just internal external for the most and
i would say that like alex is more
starter and i'm more of a follow-through
so like when we start the businesses
he's more involved in the beginning yeah
and then i'm more involved
after the like i would say like when it
comes like month eight then it really
switches over and it's like way more
layla alex starts pushing off stuff yeah
we've actually noticed that like with
each of the companies just like i
usually go i always like go off solo and
like go into a cave and like do all this
other stuff and then like things start
happening you know sales start coming in
etc and then i was like where i usually
go to layla i'm like hey uh you know
it'd be really cool if we had a team
that helped me out here and then she's
like okay and then so she comes in and
she comes so we're kind of like

43
00:42:00.000 --> 00:43:00.000
staggered like i kind of start and then
she kind of continues and then i usually
start on like the next thing that needs
to happen in the business and then
usually once that gains traction she
comes in and then she starts building
so it's like parallel traps do you guys
ever argue
yeah yeah i mean there's things we
disagree on all the time in business
or like argue argue we disagree on stuff
rather than i would say more than we
argue yeah i mean we disagree on things
in business all the time
is anybody more consistently right than
the other we usually come to an
agreement of like i see where you're
coming from what about this
all right this sounds like the best path
let's do that so what if what if like
you guys
wanted to use the money you have in cash
you have a lot of cash yeah yeah out of
curiosity why would you do that
keep cash yeah right now everything that
we would have put money into is down
like sixty percent just because you buy
stocks well stocks are some of the
things we buy for sure but like tax
liens aren't down

44
00:43:00.000 --> 00:44:00.000
tax liens yeah i don't know what that is
you don't [ __ ] opportunity i just don't
you know opportunity folks hey how do i
get a little piece from my niece
i'll show i'll show you guys how to get
you know 25
on your money
sounds every year
guaranteed by law
i mean okay let's just talk about that
but we'll talk about it after yeah i
just found me a way to make a little
dough with the hormozes i'm in the
hormozy nation now oh my gosh or no it's
mosey nation
it's easier dude so you guys are growing
fast
everyone listen to this as i'm sure
already looked you up google if they
don't already know you but what's funny
is it's not just you and it's not just
you it's both you like you follow layla
you get freaking information you follow
alex you get information but you guys
are a couple
so it's like normally
that's not you know that's rare right
there
you know i think as we were building gym
launch alex was always external facing
out as internal yeah and then we started

45
00:44:00.000 --> 00:45:00.000
acquisition.com we were like man there's
not a lot of people like there's a lot
of people that come to us because they
know us and they like run companies
together but we're like you know it's
not something you see a ton out there or
at least being functional um or it's
like
you know they run the company together
but like they don't actually run it
equally and so we kind of wanted to he's
like a helper and a main person and like
that's not power dynamic and so
yeah sometimes there's couples that are
involved in any business together but
they are not equal in influence which
honestly people frequently think they're
like can you schedule this for alex and
i'm
like my god
but that's that's the perception is like
people like oh you mean my wife owns
this business but she's like not
involved you know what i mean yeah yeah
well that's how it normally is i would
say yeah yes there's nothing wrong with
it it's great but we wanted to like we
thought it would be cool to have the two
of us out there so that we could show
like there's different ways to do it you
know there's no right or wrong but this
is also possible yeah just different do
you guys have degrees
yeah we have undergrad degrees

46
00:45:00.000 --> 00:46:00.000
not using it i got mine in exercise
science
i got mine in business
are you using it
i would not say that i'm using the
materials that i learned in college but
do you think that the [ __ ] you learned
in college has merit
i feel like it's more valuable to learn
the theory after you have an experience
because then you can start applying the
theoretical to be like oh that's what
they meant with this but if you just
learn theory and you don't have anything
practical to apply to like i would love
to see what harvard business school and
like stanford business school is about
like that would be really cool now but i
think it'd be really hard for me and not
to say like those guys are all smart as
whips but like
for me i just at least how i learn i
feel like it's much easier for me to
learn about a framework on selling like
i didn't consume my first piece of sales
training until after i closed thousands
of sales and i was like oh
that's cool that they've got like
rapport i'm like oh yeah yeah i'd do
that making some jokes and yeah yeah i
tried to you know like these things that
you can recognize later whereas if
you're trying to like learn sales you're

47
00:46:00.000 --> 00:47:00.000
like build rapport you know what i mean
like
figure out the problem you know do you
think sales is natural or it can be
learned i think you can improve on it
but i think there are people who are
naturally in sales just naturally better
because they're because they're
funnier
because of whatever soup of dna and
nurture they had in their upbringing but
like it's funny because actually use an
example um
all so many of the people that i know
are exceptional at selling um almost all
of them
were immediately
one class and then
spent a lot of their time because
usually they move up in whatever
organization thinking like how am i as
good as i am and they start trying to
teach and duplicate the skills in other
people
and so that's why i think there's like a
little bit of nature nurture you can
absolutely get somebody who's not good
at sales to be better like everyone can
improve but i think there are that when
i look at the people who teach sales a
lot of times almost all of them were
exceptional like very quickly and so
that's
that's why i'm like is it nature's
nurture and like when we build sales
teams i'd rather pick people who've got

48
00:47:00.000 --> 00:48:00.000
who look like stallions and then like
train them to run in a certain direction
rather than try and start working out
the legs and actually build them into
something here i mean it's easier to
take a six to a nine than it is to take
a two to a six
and also there's also like people who
are situationally good at sales like a
lot of the companies we have you know
like their clients say that they have a
weight loss program and the people who
graduate that weight loss program can
sell their program because they've done
it they believe in it et cetera and so
they have all the like they don't know
that they have sales aptitude there but
they do just because they naturally
believe in the product and so their
whole sales teams are built out of these
women who lost like you know 50 100
pounds at their program they have no
like formal training or anything and
they couldn't sell a car they couldn't
sell software they couldn't sell
anything else they could sell that thing
yeah they're convicted because they're a
you know
example of the product yeah they just
have all the things that you try to
create with sales training are just
inherent to them because they have the
belief yeah
so i get a lot of people following and
listening to this that are like

49
00:48:00.000 --> 00:49:00.000
entrepreneurial
when i have an event like people show up
and they're like dude how do you get so
many real
mofos to show up and i'm like i don't
know
um but you know maybe i'm real but at
the end of the day they do
so listeners
how do they like submit go to
acquisition.com yeah they go
acquisition.com click the button
if you're if you've gotten to this level
of success of the company you have
you'll be able to figure it out
yeah and then you guys that's ultimately
what you spend your days doing when you
say you're building acquisition.com most
of our time
you're looking at different deal flow
no we have someone else who looks at the
deal flow sorts it and brings like top
contenders to us see now that's smart
see what i'd be doing i'd be down there
in the mess trying to get all freaking
dirty i've been going nuts it's just
it's it's own full-time job so yeah but
that's but that's a smart move you're
filtering out and you're you're saying
hey just bring me the cream
yeah and we spend most of our time
talking to the current portfolio
companies
what are the parameters what does the

50
00:49:00.000 --> 00:50:00.000
cream look like that's a good question
well the first one is filtering for the
person so i mean i would say
that's probably piece if we look at
different things i probably look at the
person you're probably going to look at
the market so i'll cover that piece
which is you know we have our three core
values which is sincere candor
unimpeachable character and competitive
greatness and that's what we kind of
formulate those because those are hiring
parameters for us like we won't hire
somebody who doesn't have those three
things how do you know though based on
an interview i mean we've put together
basically like a list of questions for
each one yeah um and then you know i
mean i like stock them online so you can
go look at all their profiles go look at
past things client reviews like you can
get it just for people nowadays it's
very transparent um so you can find
examples and then you can ask them
questions like situational
you know whatever interview questions i
guess you could say um to see how they
handle those and how they even just how
they answer the questions you know like
i would say that
one of the biggest things we look for
someone doesn't have an ego you know
someone's not coachable and they have an
ego and they think um
that their way is the right way and
they're they're even though they want

51
00:50:00.000 --> 00:51:00.000
help they're still like kind of trying
to position with us it's just not gonna
be a good fit and we look for people who
are really humble they have a lot of
humility they're really open and minded
and coachable and they understand that
we're also we don't think that we are
also like god and going to be right
every time it's a partnership and so i
think filtering for the person is the
first thing
and that's probably the most important
because
i mean whether humans like it or not we
will talk more to people that we like
and so if we don't like them because
they don't fit these three traits it's
not it's doing them a disservice because
i'm just inherently not going to
proactively reach out to them as much so
if somebody got declined
after their submission is it because you
didn't like them well he's got the other
half there's lots like right off the bat
probably 80 of the of the deals get get
filtered out because of just automated
rules of like they're not big enough
they're currently we don't take anyone
outside of the u.s so like they're out
of the country it might be like
manufacturing which is something that we
don't do so you know i mean like if they
if one of the obvious knows even it's
amazing business is just that our
amazing business so those are the
automated rules and then layla touched

52
00:51:00.000 --> 00:52:00.000
on the entrepreneur which candidly is
still like 80 of the decision maybe even
more um and then
the remainder of the decision is do we
like the business do we like the market
and the business matters less because we
can change the business like more or
less so it's really when we talk about
the business it's like
is the depth of experience of the
founder sufficient that we think it can
build a big enough base to get to 50 100
million so a lot of times and we're a
lot of most of our businesses are
education businesses so they teach some
sort of skill um and so you know if
someone's had a moderate level of
success in doing the skill and then
immediately started teaching it they're
usually they don't have the depth of
experience to really build a big thing
whereas if someone has really deep
experience really deep industry
knowledge on how to do something really
really well there's just a lot more
potential that we can then wrap around
with a much better business so there's
the the depth of experience of the
founder from the skills perspective and
then the marketplace that we're serving
and like what we the perceived value
that we see that they could potentially
offer
say sometimes
we have a founder who is is selling

53
00:52:00.000 --> 00:53:00.000
something or has an ability that they're
not even monetizing and we see that as
like a huge untapped opportunity and
that's where like okay this is where we
like we talk in triple so it's like
first triple is going to be you know
fixing this back end second triple is
going to be x y and z and so if we see
the two triples that's when we get much
more interested um but like as a quick
total tangent on what layla said because
you said like how do you test for that
one we're wrong plenty but um if you
said like hey what's your um give me an
example of something that you failed at
in the past right and they'll say
something that like or your biggest
failure and they'll give you some
example and you're like so why do you
think that happened
it doesn't really matter what the
failure was
but when they start explaining why they
think it happened if you see someone
who's like well they didn't give me the
support i needed you know that they just
set me up on my own and i had no support
blah blah blah then they're just giving
all the control to circumstances and
other people whereas if someone's like i
probably could have you know told
management much better like how much i
needed help um i probably uh could have

54
00:53:00.000 --> 00:54:00.000
done x y z earlier to communicate these
things whatever um then they're taking
ownership and so it's just an easy
differentiator that has nothing to do
with the failure but how they perceive
the failure and so you can tell by how
they speak about it it gives you some
insight what do you say if you're doing
it face to face and
someone's clearly a no how do you
tell them no how do you end the meeting
i'm just honest you know i think when we
have those meetings that the times that
it's been us and we've had to say
something just to me like i'm gonna be
just really up front you know seems like
you've got something working really well
for you you seem very bright and very
smart i don't know if you need us so i
put it more back on us like they're like
no no no no
i want you to i want you to i'm like i
get that but it would be doing you a
disservice to take you on knowing what i
know which is that i don't think we can
add significant value based on what
you've told me you don't get any
stalkers that like you have to like
just get point blank with
not really not from the applications
yeah not from like not from companies
that have gotten to that point where
they're already doing three to ten
million entrepreneurs
i mean entrepreneurs can be eclectic but
they're not insane
are you guys getting stalkers with your

55
00:54:00.000 --> 00:55:00.000
social media
i wouldn't say like stalkers
you getting crazy fans that are finding
you out in public and wanting
yeah that's something wrong we haven't
had anyone be like super weird i mean
maybe a couple years ago we had some
stuff but
we're pretty we figured out how to like
you know not let those things be online
and some people get nervous like in
person and all you know they're probably
a little bit different than they would
normally be and they talk a little
faster they're sweating but like that's
[Music]
nice
i think it's actually an age thing like
i've noticed a lot of like younger
people probably get more nervous yeah or
freak out and scream you know type thing
versus like i think the older someone is
the more they're like they just come and
want to have a conversation we like we
will ask them questions have a
conversation so who do you think what do
you guys look up to who do you admire
elon and jeffy b
why so then one

56
00:55:00.000 --> 00:56:00.000
i consider them a first name basis
because they're my my fictitious friends
why why jeff be
i mean he's done something that you know
i think we aspire to be able to build
he's built something that's helped
zillions of people like hundreds of
zillions of people every single day just
live a little bit better of life you
know elon said the same thing and he's
helping the planet and he's trying to
save humanity like he's combined
doing good for society with making a
profit which is i mean that's the
the holy grail so i'm so concerned well
like i mean don't you think that amazon
was just a good idea like
they started out as a book company
and then it's like hey why don't we just
let
people get access to anything
well that's that's that would have been
a natural progression for me i don't
think you had to be a genius to figure
that out
and then and then
i don't know how he marketed it or how
amazon became amazon but like
to me amazon's not rocket science it's a
it's a

57
00:56:00.000 --> 00:57:00.000
24 7 store with cheap prices and
immediate delivery
because that that [ __ ] on amazon ain't
even amazon's half the time you buy it
on amazon it comes from freaking walmart
and vice versa i'm not [ __ ] you some
of those
or automated uh
called ecom stores
i i ordered something one time from
amazon it showed up in a walmart box
yeah
i'm like what the hell that starts from
everywhere yeah but then i started
talking to these uh ecom guys and that's
what happens
so do you think that's a genius
amazon was that genius i think so i
think if you've read like his letters to
shareholders like i read like the
there's i don't know 20 something years
of letters
i think that most people just give up
and so that's why they don't get worried
so like is it a genius idea
maybe maybe not but the fact is like he
didn't get any returns for his
shareholders for like i mean gosh 12 or
something i mean it was ridiculous
amount of years
yeah
and what was the shareholder saying yeah
he didn't take any money and he just
over and over and over again sold them

58
00:57:00.000 --> 00:58:00.000
he's like in 20 years in 30 years this
thing is going to take over the world
it's going to be enormous this is what
it's going to look like
yeah and so i think that kind of
fortitude and almost like
hard-headedness to reach that goal i
don't think most people have that yeah
you know let's see it's genius execution
you know i mean like that's that's why i
think like that's what the genius of the
and like especially at that size it's
genius and recruiting talent because
jeff bezos isn't building amazon he's
building the people who build the teams
who build amazon um and so it's like i
think it's just continuing to move up
from the scale of leverage you know per
unit of time and so they've just figured
out how to get the most return on their
time by using every form of leverage
that we have what do you think the most
ingenious invention of all time has been
my favorite one is air conditioning
probably something i've never especially
after you live here
i don't keep up with much of like the
stuff like inventions in the ai
yeah like dude whoever thought of google
that was a genius move you remember like

59
00:58:00.000 --> 00:59:00.000
ask jeeves lycos like there was all
these other search engines that happened
at the time and so it's your point about
like is it the idea or is it the
execution
um i guess why i think the geniuses is
that they were able to like they have
the character traits they've been able
to like persevere so
the idea is simple
the execution is hard well like youtube
and vimeo for example i heard vimeo was
first
yeah and youtube dominated and the main
reason youtube dominated is because they
had like eight share buttons and vimeo
only had one yeah
i believe it i mean it's execution right
it's like it's all the little things
that add up that become a big thing
so have you guys
cracked any good freaking sweet
partnerships at acquisition already
you mean in terms of uh companies that
were like that could sell or that like
i've brought a lot of that you've said
okay we're in you're right i like you oh
yeah the three things yeah yeah
absolutely we have you know
eight right now what's your goal

60
00:59:00.000 --> 01:00:00.000
it's less about a number goal because
and this is why warren buffett's also
one of my heroes because you know he has
19 people who work at berkshire hathaway
and then they are responsible for 500
000 or a million employees uh like so
that's the holdco and so you just have
this very concentrated group of really
hard-working really cool really smart
people who are able to influence just
you know zillions and zillions of
customers um
don't you ever find that
it's hard to keep the the true ones
because the true ones are going to say
why would i do it for you when i do it
for myself
do what for us
whatever you want me to do for you
if i'm your that employee number two
i mean i i think of it in terms of the
same way with customers which is like if
you want to keep a team you have to give
more than you're receiving yeah like you
have to always look at it like that and
most employers do not they look at it
like what am i getting from you rather
than like
focusing on like when's the last time i
gave to my team like how much am i
giving how much goodwill am i putting in
with my team and good people
i mean naturally you're going to want to
do that if they fit i think the core
values but then i think second to that

61
01:00:00.000 --> 01:01:00.000
is like
that's how they will be treated
elsewhere that's how they would get
treated so if you want to keep them you
would have to do that yourself i'm
talking about the ones that are so damn
good to just do it themselves
oh like so we
i think
okay um i think there's different kinds
of
people which
and they recognize value in different
ways which is there's a lot of people
that can do things on their own but they
value having a team of people around
them they value the growth it provides
they value the insights that you get
they value how much they're going to
learn they value the skills that they're
going to accumulate in your company and
so i think it's the bigger vision that
you can create and that you can paint
for your company they can fit their big
vision within that company and so that's
the longer you want to retain someone
the bigger your vision needs to be
because then there's more runway for
their vision so their vision might be
they have this 20 year vision for their
career and your vision for your company
say it's a 100 year vision then they can
fit that 20 years into your vision if
you have that much runway but a lot of
people only have a two or four or maybe
not even your vision so they only see
like i can acquire these one or two
skills at your company and then i'm

62
01:01:00.000 --> 01:02:00.000
gonna leave because i don't see any
runway like i don't know what comes
after that and so i think that's how you
can actually keep talent is if you do
that and then you constantly remind them
of it you know like with people on our
team i'm constantly talking about
where in the beginning we said they
could end up and like how are they
measuring in terms of like are they
going to get there what kind of things
you need to change in order to achieve
that goal like what's it going to look
like when you're only over two people
now but you're going to have 100
underneath of you in x amount of years
so i think it's it's painting that
vision and making sure that there's
aligns with the greater one of the
company it's kind of like vision for the
portfolio companies it's like this is
where you're trying to go it's just on a
on a micro scale down level but they're
also going to build something underneath
of them just like a portfolio company
ceo would and i got this from uh steven
swartzman in his book what it takes but
he said and it was just such an
awakening for me but he was like level
10 talent is only attracted to level 10
opportunities
and so you know if you have this
unbelievable genius coder marketer
builder whatever if you can attract them
to like facebook employees lots of very
very smart people and
some people at facebook make 10 million
20 million 50 million dollars a year and

63
01:02:00.000 --> 01:03:00.000
they make more than
99.99 of entrepreneurs and so like i
think as long as the vision's big enough
and they can fit like like layla said
and the opportunity they can see a lot
of people are like well on a
risk-adjusted basis
i see this thing going all the way to a
billion or 10 billion i'm one of the
first you know 20 in this company and
they have you know equity plans and
stock options and things like that so i
get to participate as an owner but i
don't have the risk of trying to build
this on my own i get to get paid the
whole time a lot of people that's a
pretty attractive deal man you guys
seem to have it all figured out hardly
there's
there's a lot of people are struggling
just to get into the a fraction of the
position you guys are in why do i say
that well it's not just the dough
it's it's the ability to to produce
at will
you know what i mean i think it's just
taking like you know i think willingness
to fail you know like both of us in the
beginning especially like we were
willing to just eat [ __ ] for a long time

64
01:03:00.000 --> 01:04:00.000
and you probably still are yeah 100 but
yeah
we're working more now than we have in
the last two years three years but i
mean i'll bet you there's more to it
than anybody even knows only youtube
really knows
it's cool it's a good model
i think a lot of people think oh it's
alex and layla you know investing in
companies and they're you know here's my
cell phone number and you know text me
if you need me and maybe i'll get on the
phone with you once a month type thing
because that's what a lot of consult
like people say they're gonna do when
they take equity
and i would just not be able to sleep at
night if that was the case you know
we're this is a company where we're
going to be able to improve every
department we have strategic advising we
have tactical advising we have
recruiting we have i.t we've got our
basically our sop and our system for
each leg of their business that we're
going to help imprint so that we can
grow it and so i think it's
the way that we see that we can over
deliver to the companies which is what
we want to do because that's just like

65
01:04:00.000 --> 01:05:00.000
part of our brand um i think seeing it
play out in the next two years will be
really cool and i hope that it sets a
new standard for the industry in terms
of if you're gonna take equity for a
company you better deliver on this level
because i think a lot of people can just
talk people who are really susceptible
into giving them equity and not
delivering yeah
yes
i mean i could do it right and i've been
offered equity and i tell them i'm like
dude why would you give me twenty
percent of your company so yeah call me
once a month yeah yeah i don't even know
what the hell you're doing i'm still
trying to figure out my [ __ ]
so i mean the goal with acquisition too
is um we wanted to build a business that
built businesses so we didn't have any
attention like we don't have any
intention of ever selling
acquisition.com because you know having
now gone through exiting the other three
businesses i think we learn a lot but
like we
we're building you know what we consider
like our core team of geniuses um and
just hardworking really really smart
people who have tons of experience in
these domains and so
if we wanted to build or get exposure to
a certain marketplace let's say we
wanted to you know get exposure to web 3
and crypto and all this stuff

66
01:05:00.000 --> 01:06:00.000
rather than say like oh let's go start a
web 3 company we'd say well let's just
see if we can find a web3 company that
fits within our values and then we can
help build that business as a part of
the portfolio um and then from like an
overarching perspective you asked
earlier like why do we have so much cash
or why are we not investing as heavily
and i think it partially goes for us
you know
being genius investors at least that's
just not i just don't think that's my
like we didn't make the money that we
have being investors we made the money
that we have building businesses and so
i don't want to try and compete in a in
a vehicle that i'm not
that i don't think i have the experience
to be the best at um i'm not saying
we're the best of business but we have
already laid a track down that we
we've put some level of time into this
game so we get disproportionate returns
for every additional year we put into it
and so the equity value that is held in
acquisition.com that's the thing that
will be worth a billion five billion ten
million plus in the future not what i do

67
01:06:00.000 --> 01:07:00.000
with like necessarily even the money
that comes out of that business and so
anyways that's that's at least how i see
us getting to our like financial goals
through that vehicle yeah and i think
just to add to that is
could we learn the investing side and
make a billion from investing absolutely
it has been a conversation it was
probably more like a year and a half ago
we were trying to figure out what we're
gonna do after we sold the companies and
i know for me specifically and then alex
agreed i'm like dude i do not want the
life of somebody who does that like i
know plenty of people who do and they
make boatloads of money i don't like it
you know it's not like i want to be
working with people helping businesses
grow like in the dirt like doing that
stuff i don't want to be working out
these spreadsheets and you know making
deals and negotiations like we know the
life because we have so many people that
do it and it's just not of interest to
either of us it's not what makes us
it doesn't provide much
fulfillment enjoyment
yeah well folks i was gonna say man you
better go to acquisition.com and put in
your bid but it doesn't sound like you
got much of a chance

68
01:07:00.000 --> 01:08:00.000
i mean we look at everyone thoroughly
yeah well here's what you can do anyway
you can get a 100 million dollar offer
book what's it officially hundred m
offers 100 offers yeah so you guys can
find it everywhere it's purple that's
another thing dude like you made it
purple and big
and almost uh like you know
second grade looking that's right
but it teaches you specifically and
exactly how you
lay out some some some offers yeah and
and market it yeah like those four
areas
yeah the value equation dude that thing
right there like that that
that alone is worth the price of the
book
the book was 99 cents yeah that's
another thing like dude why 99 cents
that thing should have been 99
and people would have well they may not
have bought it actually
but they didn't buy because 99 cents i
think they bought it because it's you
i think what happened so like i think
there's different ways that people can
find out about the book and for
everybody who didn't know who we were
and just goes and sees five thousand

69
01:08:00.000 --> 01:09:00.000
five stars you know on on amazon they'd
be like well there's other five thousand
five star books
but this one's 99 cents i'll give it a
shot and then they you know it just it
just gets more people in because things
like what problem are we solving with
the book like why why publish the book
um it's not to make money you know
like from the book sales it's to just
give more value to the community and so
99 cents the amount of people that
bought it from like i mean it's funny
you say the 99 cents versus like 12
dollars the amount of people from like
singapore and africa and thailand and
philippines who are like i can afford
the book thank you so much for making 99
cents i'm studying it like a course i
can't afford anything else like that's
cool and the thing is like all reaching
out some of them have
uh audiences and then they shared it to
their audiences in their communities and
all of them could afford 99 cents and
then some of those people are not in
those areas but actually
in areas and know a person and so
there's it's really hard because humans
are a network since it's like really
hard to map a network but we just know
that like if we put something that's
really good out there and we provide

70
01:09:00.000 --> 01:10:00.000
significantly more than it costs in
terms of time and money because the big
cost in the book is the time not the
money um then
then more people find out about us and
then ultimately you know the worst case
scenario is someone comes in
consumes a ton of stuff makes tons of
money
that's a pretty good worst case scenario
even if they never work with us i'm like
that's cool that's great we're gonna die
it's not gonna matter anyway so whatever
that is true see
and end it with the bomb right there
folks the whole thing was bomb go check
these guys out at hormozy and layla
hormozy acquisition.com
you can google them they are they're
they're very very hard to miss
uh i think you guys
ultimately are gonna hit your billion
dollar mark faster than i think you
think
what is your goal
i think it is a billion what that is a
goal right yeah but i mean how long
though
i always say like
realistically i would like to i'll just

71
01:10:00.000 --> 01:11:00.000
give the alex goal which is ridiculously
unrealistic but i'd like to be there in
five years so it's 2022 now for the
company to be worth
uh a billion in 2027 that year uh you
know we need to be doing probably around
100 million in ebitda at that point at
the hold code level for us to
for us to hit that and so that feels i
feel like we can do that now how can the
bomb squad help
share our free content let the people
know use it make your own business
better yeah yeah yes start a business
yeah use your content help the economy
yeah get jobs yeah like build a good
team be a good person yeah be a good
person don't be greedy
don't be greedy yeah you know there's a
lot of people out there that because of
that movie wall street think greed is
good greed clarifies captures the
evolutionary essence
remember that speech
isn't good
i i'm i'm of the uh
mind that you have where like i just

72
01:11:00.000 --> 01:12:00.000
ultimately want to show people how to
succeed that's why i started those three
new businesses i started and they're all
growing rapidly and all i did was
here's a ladder you're gonna have to
sell something number one but here's a
ladder it's sturdy if you're willing to
climb you'll you'll get up out of the
rat race yeah and then start them there
you guys are kind of doing the same
thing for businesses yeah so [ __ ] dude
well how do i get you guys to run life
no
i knew it
you guys you guys
you guys just need to go in sit down in
those offices
and then call me in 90 days and say dude
it's fixed yeah you're welcome and tell
me what you want for it
because i'll tell you right now man you
guys freaking if you guys knew what was
happening here you guys would be like
holy [ __ ] we we can't not do this
and it's education you're an educator
you're an educator
this is education i think i i think
realistically vision-wise

73
01:12:00.000 --> 01:13:00.000
if lightspeed was was was ran
to that level like a real c-suite in in
here because right now it's just me and
my partner which
they're
founders right so
you bring in a real team of executors
like you're talking about this this
company could end up being worth
tens of billions simply from the
education space meaning schools
like we have one right now we're
starting it's basically first grade
second grade third grade on demand
oh that's cool with all these school
shootings so once that thing's
accredited dude there's parents all over
the country that would much rather have
their kids sit down at a computer and
go through the the the classes rather
than go to school people say well what
about like interaction what about like
social skills
i have no answer for that but throw a
party three times a week and have them
all show up and play with each other i
don't know i think that a lot of kids
can get more social skills from sports
and after school activities than they do
from sitting in a classroom watching a
teacher all day and not only that some

74
01:13:00.000 --> 01:14:00.000
of the social skills they develop there
are from other [ __ ] kids yeah that
are freaking talking about you know
[ __ ] and [ __ ]
serious i don't know much about school
right now but but anyway so that's just
again one of those visionary things
where man what if lightspeed
corrected the educational space where
it was literally with every kid or
college level person down
in the country that's billions that's a
cool idea that's a big vision is that
not billions no i mean i mean that's a
vision big enough for others for sure
for sure because there is no other
interactive technology out there that
i've seen yeah you've seen you you
toyed with it so so again like what
would you do if you were me let's just
end it
pick one what so there's like the sales
coaching there's the the actual software
product itself there's the you know
doing first grade second grade you know
the automation of school whatever you
want to call it um there's just all of
like all of them are massive
opportunities it's just like you can
always you can you gotta

75
01:14:00.000 --> 01:15:00.000
how do i get you to help me pick
[Music]
see i'm going to recruit them somehow
some way only because i got the public
in public on you depression folks go
follow these cats as always until next
time keep it real
dropping bombs with the real bradley
