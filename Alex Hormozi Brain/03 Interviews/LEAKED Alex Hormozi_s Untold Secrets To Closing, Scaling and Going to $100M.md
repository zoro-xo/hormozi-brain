00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:00.000
so when the world went on lockdown i
interviewed one of my good friends alex
homozy because i wanted to really tap
into his mind and his brilliance when it
comes to sales high ticket closing
especially during a time like this now
it wasn't just an interview i wanted to
really drill
and grill him on all these different
questions the what is he doing
differently how is he doing it and by
the way if i've never heard of alex he
literally five years ago he was a
hundred thousand dollars in debt and he
took his entire business and his company
to over 100 million in just five years
and this entire interview that i did
with him was never released to the
public it just sat there in my drive on
my computer and nothing happened and i
had no intentions to release it
until now and for the first time ever
this interview where i talked to alex
about high ticket sales his mindset his
strategy what he's doing differently is
going to reveal to you for the very
first time and if by the end of this
video you're going to be able to

2
00:01:00.000 --> 00:02:00.000
understand ultimately what truly makes
the difference between the top 0.1 of
entrepreneurs especially during a time
like this when it comes to mindset sales
and pivoting
let's go
[Music]
hey welcome everybody today i have a
special guest alex hormozy has been
helping gym owners scale when it comes
to getting more leads and getting more
sales more visibility i've personally
known and seen alex grow from like
starting his entire business and his
entire empire jim lawrence and growing
it to like the empire it is today um
done over 75 million dollars in sales
helping him on scale and
today i wanted to come from this angle
of because i feel that gym owners are
probably one of the hardest hit right
now and i wanted alex to share his
insights in terms of how what should you

3
00:02:00.000 --> 00:03:00.000
actually do so you could be in a
different industry you could be in fnb
you could be in retail but
i wanted you to hear first hand from
alex on exactly
what you should be doing if you are in
that situation so first of all alex
thank you so much for being here
thanks hunter
honored honor to join yeah and and i
think that
right now what the question i want to
begin with is
so if i have a physical location just
like a gym owner
what should be the first thing i should
be doing or focusing on
right now i think the first thing is
actually a mindset in terms of changing
your perspective about what you're
delivering your your clients right in a
coven you know environment
the the demand or the need
for the service or the problem that's
trying to be solved still exists like
people are still overweight like that
hasn't changed it's simply the vehicle
that you're delivering the outcome has
changed right but if you have the skill
set to help someone lose weight

4
00:03:00.000 --> 00:04:00.000
uh you can still apply that in a virtual
setting and so just first off
understanding that dynamic is important
before we even like get
move forward
the second piece is
the way that you can create a value
discrepancy right the only reason that
people continue to pay is because they
feel like they get more for their money
than they would get using their money
elsewhere right
and so
a lot of gym owners had a lot of
struggles because we work with
specifically more boutique owners so you
know crossfit's boot camp summer private
facilities kind of more service-based
facilities
um where they're like well going from in
person to remote i'm i'm losing value
which typically would be true
but
we position is going from group
to one-on-one
and so when you think about it like that
then all of a sudden your value
distribution changes because one on one
in person might be a you know
two thousand dollar a month you know
personal training cost but you're going
to be able to deliver that for a tenth
of the cost in a remote setting and so
if you look at how much that client

5
00:04:00.000 --> 00:05:00.000
might be paying you they might have been
paying you 200 a month for their
crossfit membership and now they're
paying you 200 a month for one-on-one
you know workouts in your tradition that
would go with it so we're still getting
to the same goal we shifted from group
to in person but we're able to do that
because leverage is so much better on
the internet so just changing the way
you look at it mindset and understand
that people's problems are still the
same and you can still deliver the same
outcome in a different environment okay
very nice so
in terms of the execution then let's
talk about the marketing and what they
should be doing on social media in their
lead gen in their closing in their sales
process what what needs to be different
now in order to make that happen
i'll talk about two things one is the
messaging the messaging switches from a
bull or a bear market from a prosperous
economy to a preservation economy and so
all of the words change and so there's
there's been studies on this that in a
typical a normal economic environment

6
00:05:00.000 --> 00:06:00.000
gain versus savings will out i'll
compete savings two to one so thrive
prosper i call it prosperity doctrine
will out-compete preservation doctrine
two to one
but in a recessionary environment
it switches to be four to one
in favor of preservation doctrine and so
you actually have a stronger buying
impetus or threshold in a recessionary
economy if you can change your messaging
so if you looked at all of jim launch's
stuff overnight i'm just talking about
it in different settings that's b2b i'll
go b to c in a second if you look at how
everything that we've talked about in
gym lunch it's all about survival
and pain right that's all of our
messaging has changed it's not fill your
gym make more money you know
seven-figure jet like all of that is
typical messaging buckets that that
would convert in any normal economy but
overnight that stopped converting and so
then we ramped up an entirely new
messaging different messaging buckets
around the pain of cancellations the
pain of people leaving you the cost of
keeping your facility open um and just

7
00:06:00.000 --> 00:07:00.000
about survival right and so savings and
discount now have far more like i've
never given a discount on any offer in
four years
and in this economy i'm willing to do
discounts only right because in this
economy
people are super responsive to that so
we're actually
in this time we've actually decreased
our cost of acquisition by uh by five
six so our cost effects has gone down
a lot
uh just because like i said earlier it's
four times it's twice as strong as it is
in a normal setting so if all things are
the same you should be able to even cut
your acquisition costs in half because
the buying threshold is actually lower
if you match the right messaging so
in a fitness environment for b2c right
if you're trying to get normal consumers
they're going to still be enticed by
free offers and discount offers more so
than ever and so it's gonna be more
about how can you build a monetization
structure behind
a free or discount offer that still
allows you to liquidate acquisition
costs and still make money right and so
that's where kind of like the expertise

8
00:07:00.000 --> 00:08:00.000
comes in in terms of what are the offers
that we're going to give people what we
do is we run free challenges or we
recommend that our gyms run free
challenges now they we push straight to
a phone sale one of the big
opportunities that happen right now
which is enormous for everyone is that
overnight general population which has
still been lagging and has never been on
zoom before so like everyone who's on
here right now we're still
way ahead of the if you look at the
curve of like the normal humanity we're
still in the first half you know top
first ten percent of early adopters
innovators etc most people are in the
big chunk in the middle and they've
never used them before facetime was is
radical to them right for technology
and so but because of covid it's forced
everyone into this new bucket where they
had to learn how to use zoom they had to
learn how to operate in a remote setting
so what this allows us to do is it gives
us a blank check where everyone is now
comfortable and expecting to give their
card over the phone and so we're
actually seeing higher close rates in

9
00:08:00.000 --> 00:09:00.000
terms of percentage of leads closed
versus in person because we're actually
able to remove obstacles to getting
someone to show up and so for example uh
for us when we're generating leads for
these online campaigns we're able to get
twice as many people into a sales
environment as we were before because
they don't have to get in their car
drive to the place you know find the
time go through traffic but you know
drop their kids up they don't have to do
all that they just have to pick up the
phone and so because of that we have
twice as many at bats
and so even if your close rate drops
because and this is probably a little
bit of a mindset thing but i think it's
worth saying
of course you're not going to be good
selling over the phone you've never done
it
so why so don't expect to be like well
you know after six years we closed 70 in
person great if you had six years of
phone sales then you'd probably sell
70 over the phone you're not gonna do
that but the advantage is that you're
gonna get twice as many at bats and so
even if you suck right you close half as
many you're actually still closing the
same percentage of leads so that's
number one

10
00:09:00.000 --> 00:10:00.000
the secondary effect of this is that
because you're remote you're no longer
geographically constrained and so what
we've found is that we've been able to
go from a five mile radius for a local
gym to 25 miles and see no difference
in conversion on leads which you would
never be able to do in a normal setting
and so what that does is
it lowers the cost of acquisition
because now we have a way wider net to
pull from right and so our lead cost is
lower right um we're getting twice as
many of those leads into a sales
environment and so even if you close
half as many your cost of acquisition is
still lower and so your lifetime value
to cost of acquisition ratio is higher
which is why there is a big opportunity
right now now i don't want to talk about
opportunity because no one who's
listening to this is an opportunity
mindset but if you can then really
there's a huge there's a huge play to be
made two things that you mentioned is
really powerful and i just want to
emphasize on the things that you
mentioned number one was
uh when you talked about messaging and i
think that regardless of what industry
you're in the offer that we're selling
right now can still be the same thing

11
00:10:00.000 --> 00:11:00.000
like so for myself i'm still selling the
same thing
but my ads my messaging on social media
everything that i'm utilizing to fuel
that offer changes it just evolves
because right now rather than using the
languaging of here's how you can crush
it and here's how you can take your
business to a whole new level we're
utilizing messaging like how you can
survive and then thrive we are not
number one we do not appear as being
tone deaf and we're very empathetic to
what's happening and
number two is you talked about
lead cost falling and and this is
actually the opportunity right now um i
know like for me personally facebook ad
cost has i've never seen facebook ad
cost decrease over the last decade um it
has consistently
you know in some years doubled um and
this right now is like 2017 prices
so and that's why there's there's that

12
00:11:00.000 --> 00:12:00.000
opportunity there when it comes to um
legion
so so the next thing that i would like
to cover then is
the tweak of the offer so as a gym owner
in order to deliver that promise and
outcome of weight loss and getting fit
and building muscle
uh that's probably one of the hardest
things to do right so yes you talk about
tweaking that offer
what would the deliverable be it's a
zoom zoom call is it like a group
setting so what we wanted to do is focus
our gyms on selling we've taken out all
of the lead generation and the lead
nurture part so
as far as they're concerned people just
get scheduled on their on their on their
calendars and show up for phone calls
like they have to do nothing before that
so they just show up to the call all
right
after they make the sale
we as gym launch because we're a big
company we actually have 16 hours a day
of workouts that are being fulfilled
basically every hour of the day from
seven a.m or five a.m until whatever it
is eight or nine o'clock at night

13
00:12:00.000 --> 00:13:00.000
there's a workout every single hour
that's being done and so that's one
piece of it but that's not the main
driver because someone
can google
online workouts for free right you can
google nutrition plan for free and so
the primary value is not that stuff and
so that's the big mistake that i see a
lot of gym owners make is because they
misunderstood the core value what they
offer it to begin with
it's never been about the fork outs if
you're in our community you already know
that because that's we preach that a lot
but your workouts at your gym are
relevant they can go to planet fitness
for ten dollars a month and get group
workouts right in person
and they can get to go to beachbody
online and get nine dollar a month
workouts online that's what i'm doing
right so the the workout is a commodity
right and so how do you how do you get
out of that the only thing that you can
beat these big companies on is service
as a small business owner the only thing
you can do is beat them on service and
so
the deliverables are going to be the
one-on-one accountability right and
personalization those are the things
that a big company can't do and cohen

14
00:13:00.000 --> 00:14:00.000
you know coincidentally those are things
you can charge the most for right and so
when you're selling a client you're
selling them on the fact that the reason
they haven't been successful is not
because they didn't have lack of uh
resources right it wasn't because they
had lack of access to the things they
needed you can google all the stuff you
need you can confront that on the phone
it's like that hasn't been the problem
is it it's been getting you to do it
right and that's where i commit right
that's where me being a coach is getting
you to close the distance between what
you know you should do and what you are
actually doing right and that's where we
come in and so for us from a tactical
standpoint that's reaching out to them
three to four times a week checking in
on specific metrics and then having them
message you daily with their body weight
and the supplements that they need that
you need them to take and that way you
can consistently get them to at least
monitor their weight so that they're not
going up and then obviously make
interventions you know going forward you
know be it either cutting calories if
you need to or increasing their activity
and the thing is oh big big big picture

15
00:14:00.000 --> 00:15:00.000
getting someone to do a specific type of
workout is not a long-term intervention
just getting someone to move is like if
you could just get if we could get
everyone in the world to just walk 30
minutes a day like the average will
actually expect to go about 10 years you
just need to get them to do something
right and they just want to be held
accountable and they want to get credit
a lot of people just want a high five
it's like i showed up to the workout
today and they want someone to know that
they were supposed to go
acknowledge when they were there and
congratulate them after they were done
that's what people pay for they pay for
the feeling of knowing that someone else
gave them credit right and so ultimately
people are paying you
to pay attention
right they're paying for your attention
that is what they're trying to buy is
someone to pay attention to them to keep
them on track and so that's the core
offer is that right the other things the
meal plans the grocery list the eating
out guides the the workouts the facebook
group the q and a's like all those
things are things
but the core value is around making sure
that they're doing it
through one-on-one communication that's

16
00:15:00.000 --> 00:16:00.000
happened in the systemized process
i i love this because that
was the thing that i was like puzzled
about and and you said it best it's like
the the workouts the meal plans they're
all
that's the commodity but what people
want is that that feeling of okay
there's some i'm accountable to someone
there's that one-on-one that's the
personalization and in fact that is the
highest perceived value and then in
terms of
scalability how scalable is this then is
this really like a temporary plan in
order to survive or is this something
that can be eventually skilled so i i
under i under came a lot of fire
um in
about nine months ago i came out with
something called the hybrid gym model
which basically said two things one is
fitness and workouts or commodity based
on what i just said right you can google
workouts online you can go to planet
fitness for ten dollars a month right
workouts are not important what is
important is the one-on-one
accountability and you can in doing and

17
00:16:00.000 --> 00:17:00.000
facilitating that service have an
entirely remote client base and that's
what created a hybrid facility both in
in-person and remote
and so i encouraged jim's to make that
switch a lot of people thought that that
was a wild idea um and i was saying that
there was going to be a recession that's
going to come i had no idea it was coved
but i was like there's going to be
something that's going to knock a lot of
gyms out because it's super fat as an
industry everybody had a gym right and
they're operating on paper thin margins
and so whenever you see that it's right
for someone to just like shake the tree
and have 30 of the gym still under which
is exactly what's going to happen but in
terms of opportunity i'm bullish on the
remote gym opportunity like i think from
a scalability standpoint it's superior
from a lead generation standpoint it's
superior because you have a wider net
from a profitability standpoint it's
superior because you run 80 gross
margins you pay 20 to a coach and
typically that 80 normally would then go
towards your rent toilet paper front
desk girl all of the other costs that
would typically go with
having an in-person facility are no
longer there
and so you can really run a very high

18
00:17:00.000 --> 00:18:00.000
margin business on on roughly the same
revenue you had from a gym except
instead of opening up three more
locations
you can just keep scaling and not have
to sign more leases do more build outs
you know get tenant improvement costs
and go through construction and get
permits and like all of that stuff that
normally goes with scaling locations is
no longer a constraint online
i encourage very strongly for the gyms
to make a to make a concerted decision
of what they want to do because i think
buying behavior is fundamentally going
to change going forward even after this
because they will have been intro
introduced to remote services
and so at that point if you've replaced
your revenue or at least your income in
60 days during this corona stuff or 90
days how long attack last with 10 15 20
000 on the remote of remote income
you're probably making more from this
than you were from your gym
and then all you need to do is keep
doing what you were doing before and you
can either choose to go back to your gym
or choose not to um but that's that's
that's how i see it from an opportunity
standpoint

19
00:18:00.000 --> 00:19:00.000
nice and i want to talk about uh
implementation next in terms of like do
you have like a framework or like a
three-step five-step thing in order to
implement this and what are like the
main pillars in order is to roll this
out
so big picture there's uh there's four
core skills you have to be able to
generate leads
you have to be able to nurture leads to
get them to schedule and show
you have to be able to sell over the
phone
and then you have to be able to fulfill
and retain in a remote environment all
right there's nuances to each of these
obviously schedule and show are separate
sales there's multiple sales that have
to happen you have to sell the service
package up front then you want to sell
upsell supplements the next day then 14
days later you want to upsell continuity
like there's you know for peeling it out
so there's more wrinkles to it but from
a core core four standpoint it's
generating the leads getting them to
schedule and show selling them and then
getting being able to fulfill and retain
them
those are the four skills that need to
that every gym owner or even personal
trainer who's a wellness professional
needs to acquire and the nice thing is

20
00:19:00.000 --> 00:20:00.000
that works for pretty much every service
business right you need to generate
leads you need to nurture them you need
to sell them you need to thought
nice and
so you see this remote solution
not as a temporary measure
but
something that's actually permanent that
should be included in every gym's
business model
from this point off
i yeah i made a very strong argument for
this uh beforehand of having a dual
revenue stream model and honestly it was
i i only kept it as a dual revenue
stream model because i know that the
beliefs of my particular audience are
that they want to have a gym right and
so telling them you shouldn't have a gym
is not necessarily something that that
crushes their dreams
right right uh yeah no it does and so
for me i have to i have to cater my
message and be cognizant of that when
i'm talking about it and really balance
like what is your dream as a fitness
professional versus being a business
owner right and they're they're not
necessarily aligned and so if you're if

21
00:20:00.000 --> 00:21:00.000
you're here to maximize how much money
you can make then having a 100 remote
gym by far
like
no question makes the most sense right
but a lot of people don't want to do
that because they really like their gym
they like the community they like being
able to show up and seeing the same
people and i understand that from a
human standpoint and so it's just what
is the trade-off you're willing to make
are you able to to accomplish that same
human need
in a remote setting in a different way
um if so then this would be a superior
vehicle if you're not and you really
like that then i say awesome keep that
but still have this high high margin
revenue stream that's at least attached
to it to take care of your bills because
in general brick-and-mortar service
tends to be a low-margin business
overall and what is your take on those
uh zoom
calls with like i don't know 15 people
on
and
training as like a in a classroom format
is that effective or not is better fine
i think you have to do it the right way
so my it's my opinion that those should

22
00:21:00.000 --> 00:22:00.000
be live not recordings
and the reason for that is because
people want to be seen for showing up if
you want to watch your recording they
just google a far more professionalized
workout than what you're doing on zoom
right and so you have to use the
competitive advantages you have so do
them live
right
as soon as they come on
the first i mean if we get really
tactical the first 10 seconds you want
to demonstrate the exercise and the
remaining 40 50 seconds of that minute
that you're doing an interval or the
exercise you should be going frame by
frame and saying john keep it up susie
keep your you know butt back you know
hey you know nancy go lower and so
one of the other opportunities that's
nice about this is that typically you
can't do that in an in-person setting
you've got a huge gym you have to like
run all the way around in order to be
able to give people feedback whereas
here you can look right at the screen
and you can go all the way around and
basically every minute you can reaffirm
the client and give them feedback where
you normally wouldn't be able to do that
in a row it's like you standing right
next to every client
and so that gives you a huge advantage
from a coaching standpoint

23
00:22:00.000 --> 00:23:00.000
because you can personalize everything
much more easily and they feel like they
got 20 touch points in a session rather
than one to two which is typically kind
of what you strive for in a large group
workout
very nice
and for the last part of this call
what i would like to cover is i can see
that a huge
part of the strategy is actually closing
people on the phone and i know you've
done that very very successfully i would
love if you could share your framework
in terms of how from from the start of
the conversation to how you qualify them
all the way to close and i know that's
hard to do that in a really short period
but if you could walk us through the
methodology that that would be amazing
so i'm going to give you the framework
and then i'll give you kind of the thing
that matters more than the framework so
the framework is the closer framework
that's what we call it so
c-l-o-s-e-r so it's easy to remember all
right clarify why they're there right
why did you hey why'd you take time to
hop on the phone today
what about the ad made you you know
click and sign up right label them l
label them with a problem right okay so
got it so you you saw it because you're

24
00:23:00.000 --> 00:24:00.000
trying to trying to lose weight you're
overweight right now so you need to lose
40 pounds okay understand so you think
we like you wouldn't be upset if you
lost 40 pounds working with us would you
no okay great so oh overview their past
experiences
all right so you're like so tell me like
what have you done in the past why
hasn't that worked what do you think
that like what do you think the missing
link was right trying to try and
establish the gap right of where they're
at and why they haven't succeeded in the
past
and then s which is sell the vacation
all right so one of the big things that
most people mess up especially in
fitness is they want to talk about the
program no one cares about the program
right and so we do an overview that
takes less than 60 seconds which is
essentially breaking one core belief
which is you need three things to be
successful fitness nutrition and
accountability the reason all the things
that didn't work for you in the past is
because you lacked one two all three of
the things right you tried beachbody
online but you had no accountability so
you didn't show up and you had no
nutrition so you're still eating donuts
after your workout right you tried uh
you tried weight watchers so you had the
nutrition help but you didn't have the

25
00:24:00.000 --> 00:25:00.000
accountability and you didn't have the
workout so you ended up just getting
flabby and not toned right you just like
each one of those examples you can pull
out and say it was lacking in all three
and no one can say they had all three
because if they had all three they
wouldn't be on the phone with you right
they would already be successful
and so
once you have that it pretty much
overcomes everything because even if
someone's like well i'm in great shape
then it's like well then why are you on
the phone with me clearly you're
dissatisfied about something otherwise
you wouldn't be looking like i've told
people like i already have a personal
trainer i'm like well clearly he's
either not giving you the fitness you
want he's not helping with the nutrition
or he's not holding you accountable
right and which one is it or is it all
three and so once they have that three
pillar
right for the pitch then it's like cool
then i think you might be good for a
program and that's where you just make
your offers right whatever the offer for
the program is
and then e and r are explain away their
concerns which is going to be their
hesitations around making a decision
which everyone comes to the call with
hesitations which is why they're not in
shape to begin with and so you have to
unpack those and you know close them
despite their limiting beliefs and then
r i included r which is reinforce the

26
00:25:00.000 --> 00:26:00.000
decision
which is immediately after the sale to
prevent people from getting cold feet
and backing out which is important
especially in emotional based decisions
like weight loss etc is sending them a
care package sending them a personalized
video saying hey i'm john i'm going to
be your coach i'm super excited to work
with you you're on my team i'm sending
you a shirt right now so that you can
wear them to your online workouts um
blah blah blah right and that way they
feel like they're already taking the
first step into the community and that
kind of cements the decision so that's
the closer framework
the overarching thing i was saying that
was potentially more important than the
closure framework is understanding that
volume is k
right you have to get reps it
like if you're like well i tried the
closer framework and i'll ask how many
times i'm like well once i'm like okay
so you've had one call right even if you
were an amazing closer right and you had
five calls you're going to have one or
two that are going to say no even as an
amazing closer and you just have to
expect that it's a volume game and so
for us what we've seen in our community

27
00:26:00.000 --> 00:27:00.000
is that it takes 25 sales calls um for
someone to even become
a basic level of proficiency so just be
able to even have the conversation
without stumbling pausing
using filler words getting off script
like it takes 25 to just understand how
to even have conversations with a
defined beginning and end point right
after that then you kind of get into the
more main stretch of like okay now i'm
proficient i'm not good but i'm
proficient right but it's just breaking
everyone's beliefs who's on here right
now about like of course you're not good
at phone sales you've never done it
before
yeah like in expecting that you're gonna
be amazing day one is just gonna lead
you to just you're gonna it's gonna lead
you down the wrong path but if you can
say i'm gonna take a hundred calls and
not judge myself
i guarantee you you will be far more
successful and it doesn't really even
matter what script you're using right as
long as your offer is normal and fair by
the end of a hundred phone calls that
would be better sales training than
cardo new than my own sales training
than straight line sales the best way to
learn sales is to get on the phone

28
00:27:00.000 --> 00:28:00.000
so powerful like in fact right before
this call i actually did a facebook live
to my group and i said guys
right now the skill set that you guys
want to practice is being on webinars
because the attention is there and i
said look
chances are if it's your first webinar
you are going to suck it's going to be
horrible um nobody's going to be paying
attention you have no idea what you're
doing but that's all part of the journey
and i think this is huge like
closing on the phone it's the same thing
like for me if you ask me close somebody
on the phone that's scary for me because
that's not something i do but i can
imagine that after 25 calls
you know i would suck less you know so
i i feel that this part here is gold um
so structured but most importantly the
mindset
uh behind it and and closing on the
phone is
crucial for i think it's highly
applicable for any business really
and what's interesting about that so i
have a friend of mine who's phd

29
00:28:00.000 --> 00:29:00.000
and he does lots of behavioral analysis
all that kind of stuff
and uh when i told him that we had found
that 25 to 30 was kind of the sweet spot
where people at least started to like
kind of at least have con some
consistency to their numbers like okay
i'm closing one out of three every time
i get on that close one out of three
he said that that was 100 in alignment
with stress response theory and so if
you have a fear of spiders or fear of
whatever right
it takes 25 to 30 neutral exposures to
that stressor for you to not have a
stress response
and so essentially like everyone always
wants to play in the game like they play
in practice like why can't i play in the
game like i'm playing practice
it's because in the game you don't you
haven't had enough distraction training
which is how can i do the thing without
having the negative weight of stress
right and so the more exposures you have
to the stressor the lower your stress
becomes right like people who have never
fought before get in the ring and they
can't breathe because they're breathing
so fast they hold their breath right but
eventually the most experienced you know
fighters are relaxed when they're in the
ring and so essentially it's the same

30
00:29:00.000 --> 00:30:00.000
thing when you're selling
is that you need to be able to lower
your stress response and sometimes the
easiest way to do that is just exposure
right so that you can actually say the
script without choking up and fumbling
and feeling insecure it's just a stress
it's it's pure biology it has nothing to
do with your skill at that point so
anyways i thought i'd share that because
i thought that was really interesting
so powerful i i i think mastery is
really the ability to execute a certain
task
with minimal resources right and it's
it's
it's um goes i think every single skill
set in entrepreneurship is like that the
only reason why i can do live events and
and
without flinching without being nervous
it's because i've done hundreds of them
but
when you ask me if you were to ask me to
do like an interview or podcast like
what i'm doing now now that's different
this is probably my number like i've
done less than two dozen so far after
doing a couple i've gotten a little bit

31
00:30:00.000 --> 00:31:00.000
more relaxed
um and being on a phone is the same
thing really
so many good uh man so much gold here um
any final words to leave my audience
with when it comes to pivoting when it
comes to closing on a phone when it
comes to high ticket sales um especially
during
a time like this
tillman fertetta he's a billionaire
he said especially during recessions you
want to sell to the masses not the
classes and so
i think a lot
the rules of value are the same but the
economics around how you create value
change
and so
right now
you may have to shift from if you're to
if you're if you're accustomed to be
selling five thousand dollar fitness
programs right if you're used to that it
may mean you need to sell 50 100
programs right and it's just
understanding that because right now
like during during the recessionary
times
tons of huge businesses were founded ibm

32
00:31:00.000 --> 00:32:00.000
disney like all of these were founded
during recessionary time periods and so
what it does is it creates business
models that work
on volume typically
and so
i think that
being giving yourself permission to
create a product that serves the masses
rather than the classes is something
that um
helped me and i think it also helped my
guys out because our guys are all used
to selling two to five thousand packages
and so when i told them guys we're gonna
sell 300 packages now and this is how
we're gonna do it but they're selling
10 times as many of them there's a
certain stability that comes with volume
and right now people are willing to buy
they may just not be willing to buy for
as much and it takes a little longer for
them to trust you and so having a
multi-step sales process with kind of a
lower barrier entry point right now
is something that we're seeing big
trends if you're if you're in that
period and you're like what should i do
right now is final words is just be
willing to make those types of changes
to your business model as long as the
economics makes sense
love it

33
00:32:00.000 --> 00:33:00.000
hey alex thank you so much for doing
this um i hope you guys got tremendous
value
um and uh
we'll see you in the future calls
thanks so much man appreciate you
