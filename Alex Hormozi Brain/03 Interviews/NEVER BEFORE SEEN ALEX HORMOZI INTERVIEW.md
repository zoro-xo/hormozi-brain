00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:00.000
i'm about to share with you a
behind-the-scenes interview that we did
with the alex hermosie
right when he launched his book before
he started to blow up all over the
internet so if you wanted to ever hear
from alex before he became famous on the
internet this is going to be your chance
and the crazy part about this is that
i'm giving you guys an inside look to an
interview that i did inside of my
private mastermind which people invest
tens of thousands of dollars to access
so you guys are about to get this 100
for free and the best part about this
interview is that i ask alex some
challenging questions that i don't
believe he's been ever asked anywhere
before for example i asked him the
famous peter thiel question which is
what is something that you believe in
that most people don't agree with you on
and the answer was really really
interesting so if you want to hear from
alex before he blew up and get an inside
sneak peek on our private mastermind

2
00:01:00.000 --> 00:02:00.000
which again is tens of thousands of
dollars then keep watching and with that
mind let's dive into the interview first
things first i'm going to skip the
shampoo question
the second question
someone asked what shampoo regimen you
follow
someone someone else asked what is
something that you truly believe in that
many people would disagree with you
about
you ask me peter thiel's question
yeah
i think that
people should pick their spouses based
on
um
basically like a business partner and
not based on uh romance
hmm fascinating
do you want to go deeper
um
you know the
probably the most important decision
that you make in your life is who you
choose to have as your spouse or partner
um i mean you think about like how many
times who here has had more than one
business since they started their
entrepreneurial career
you get a hand
right and so for some reason as
entrepreneurs we're so obsessed with
this decision and yet we approach

3
00:02:00.000 --> 00:03:00.000
dating or lifetime partnership kind of
haphazardly without process
and so
it is like it has a 0.71 correlation to
your subjective well-being or how happy
you perceive yourself to be it's based
on the strength of your relationship
with your significant other no it has
nothing to do with your business success
or how much money you make and so most
of us are here for freedom or at least
you know to feel better in a certain way
and so to to let that one go by chance
and just say well i guess we've been
together for a few years
you know let's let's let's get hitched
you know which is how i feel a lot of
people uh get married and sometimes in
the entrepreneur space
we don't think about how we're going to
grow as entrepreneurs
and in many ways leave the people that
we are dating behind because they're not
they are not
exposed to the same stimuli as we are
and so i think most systems will adapt
to whatever stimulus is put in front of
it and if we're consistently getting
exposed to different stimuli then we're
going to grow apart inevitably and so
the idea is like how can i find somebody
who has an aligned mission and align
values so they want to go where i want
to go and they want to get there the way

4
00:03:00.000 --> 00:04:00.000
i want to get there so that we don't so
that at the onset we have that that
shared path so that was something that i
did not do for the earlier part of my of
my romantic dating and then um as i got
older i realized that it felt like every
relationship that i had was always
uh pulling away at what i wanted to do
with my life everything was always a
trade-off it was hey you can work but
after that we need to go to my friend's
place after that hey let's go do this
thing that i don't care about right um
and the thing is is like i think it's
important to have compromises but if
your entire life is a compromise then
you might be trading the wrong things
and you don't necessarily have to make
those trades and so i think that for a
lot of people for those of you because i
think it seems like it's somewhat
younger crowd if you can hit if you can
take pause for a second um
like
my wife and i when we met we were not we
did not have like a romantic chemistry
and
when i when i ended up proposing to her
it was actually a proposition it was a
proposition in the truest sense of the
word it was not a
roses and candles i said you know
you're persian i'm persian you like

5
00:04:00.000 --> 00:05:00.000
fitness i like fitness you like making
money in business and so do i
and i believe in your character and we
have aligned ethics and values
i think it makes a lot of sense for us
to get married what would you think
and she said yeah i think it would make
a lot of sense and i was like all right
then i guess we should get you a ring
and so then we went to the store and got
her ring and came back 45 minutes later
and i was like all right well
i guess we should get married then and
she was like yeah i think so so i called
up a church and we went there four days
later and got married um in the
background does that sound fair alex is
that was that was that the closing
question
would you be opposed to spending the
rest of your life with me
she said no to say yes um she said no
i'm not opposed to it i was like fair
enough
um and i just i think that the reason
that we i've had disproportionate levels
of success faster i think than most
people is because i've had a tremendous
level of support for my wife um and my
businesses i i was decent at business i
had six gyms um when i was 26 or 27
um
on my own but i didn't start making most

6
00:05:00.000 --> 00:06:00.000
people consider
tremendous amounts of money
until i had her support and um
and i think that you need to have that
that dynamic very clearly formed and
very cl just like a business clear
divisions of labor clear roles clear
responsibilities
um and honestly clear agreements of like
this is what i will do this is what you
will do this is what's expected and then
then you then you fulfill those
agreements and i think it a lot of
people don't even have couldn't even say
that to their partner right now and i
think that's a shame
yonko thank you so much for asking that
question what a really powerful question
to start with guys if you love that
answer drop a one
i'm freaking
so excited to have alex on that's
i think that's part of what makes you
you man like
your ability to see the world just a
little bit differently and um live it in
your way
so next up jan asked
why do people think so small
and
let's let's

7
00:06:00.000 --> 00:07:00.000
uh shift the question a little bit alex
do you feel like you think
small for yourself do you feel like you
fall into that or no
i think everything's relative you know
if you go to somebody in sri lanka and
tell them what you guys goals are they
would think that you're
the richest man in babylon if you go to
you know a billionaire and tell them
what your goals are they would tell you
that you're why bother right but i think
that as much as we can look back on our
old goals because i think to myself like
what if i had the brain or mind that i
have now i think you earn those steps
you know i mean i think you earn that
perspective and i mean there's
definitely a big degree of believing
yourself but then there's also the equal
side of it of being delusional and i
think i think success lies in the
balance of those
because if you have too much delusion um
not based in reality you're not going to
achieve and you're just going to say i'm
going to be a billionaire um when you
haven't even made a hundred grand right
on the flip side if you if you are so
based in reality you're only gonna look
at the people who are around you and so
i think that in my opinion for me the
things that have been most valuable for

8
00:07:00.000 --> 00:08:00.000
increasing
my beliefs so i mean if anybody's
followed any of my stuff like i believe
that there's three things at every level
of entrepreneurship that you have to
renew right you have to renew the skills
the traits and the beliefs and so
basically at every level and this
actually works at an employee level too
if you were limited so right now
it's like everyone here so this is me
talking to you if your business has
stayed at the same level
for six months a year whatever right
then rather than saying i am stuck
simply asking better questions will
usually allow you to have better answers
right if we have stupid questions we get
stupid answers and so i think clarity of
thought is so important because then it
makes answering the questions easier and
so if you ask yourself and this is an
easier way to do it people who are ahead
of me in my space people who you
probably may think are your competitors
who may be making more money than you
and you may be upset by that but don't
let your emotions get in the way because
they're better than you and so you have
to figure out why they're better than
you and so the idea is do they have a
skill that i lack
do they have character traits that i

9
00:08:00.000 --> 00:09:00.000
lack or do they have beliefs about the
worlds that are different than me all
right so if you're good with it joel
i'll explain an example of each of those
um yeah of course
so
you can use me as a guinea pig if you'd
like
so
here's a simple example let's say you
have the skills to market right so you
have the skills of marketing and sales
um
and you believe that you can achieve
more right but you're still stuck right
if that's you or many entrepreneurs
oftentimes they lack the character
traits of being persistent they lack the
character traits of focus and so they
have those skills but they're applying
them to hey i have to see if this niche
or this niche will be better i'm going
to try them both out and see which one
works maybe that sounds familiar to
somebody on here right when in reality
either niche would work but both will
not because you cannot focus and that is
a character trait deficiency not a skill
deficiency or belief deficiency a
different example is i had a friend of
mine who had a fitness app he um he was
a crossfit games competitor he got
pretty high up he was like fourth

10
00:09:00.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and uh his app was pretty good he was
doing like twenty thousand dollars a
month but he didn't promote it at all
because he was ashamed that he wasn't
the crossfit champion he didn't think he
deserved to promote it because he wasn't
number one and so finally he got enough
positive feedback from the app that he
said i guess i can start promoting it
and within months he was doing a hundred
thousand dollars a month the product was
there he had the character traits of
work ethic right so he had the skills of
creating the product he had the
character traits but he just didn't
believe it right so we had to change his
belief about the world and then he got
the outcome right
and so those are those are the examples
of the traits and the beliefs the
simplest one in my opinion is fixing is
fixing skill deficiencies right so for
example if right now you're like hey man
i can't this is a common one probably
for a lot of your audience hey i can't
find a good salesman
no one can sound like me
by the way terrible belief about the
world
but if that was something that you said
for example then if you can state your
problem as a deficiency then it's much
easier to solve so you say i don't know
how to find a good salesperson so then
what i should be focused on is the skill

11
00:10:00.000 --> 00:11:00.000
of recruiting sales people and once you
find good sales people it's like well
then i lack the skill of managing and
training good sales people
and so once you have a managed and
trained good sales person then you might
be like hey man i don't know how to i
don't know how to scale a sales team
well then you start reading books on how
to manage and scale a sales team and how
to have a pipeline of salesmen and have
a recruitment process a farm process
that builds a sales team right and how
do you incentivize them as a team how do
you manage them as a team right because
that is yet another skill that you lack
and so if you think about the problems
that you're experiencing or you're
hitting a plateau you have to at least
for me i think is there is there a skill
deficiency that i have is it a trait
that i lack or is it a belief about the
world and so for me personally when i
had my kind of first explosion we went
from 3 million improv to 17 million in
profit between two years which is pretty
crazy right that wasn't revenue that was
profit this was three or four years ago
the reason that i had that unlocking was
because i had a mentor tell me he said
hey man you have a level 10 skill set
and a level 2 opportunity

12
00:11:00.000 --> 00:12:00.000
he said you shouldn't be running gyms
you should be showing people how to run
gyms the way you run them
and for me that was a belief that
changed i had the traits because i had
the work ethic i had the dedication i
had the focus i had the skills i was
already running a six person sales team
um at the time and we were already doing
you know 50 sales a day so i was used to
high volume sales i just had i had to
switch my vehicle so that was a belief
change and so i think i was able to
explode
because i had so much operational
experience between six locations
and so people were like how did it
happen so quickly it was because i think
the rungs of the latter which is how i
visualize this is you have your beliefs
as one vertical you have your traits as
one vertical and then you have the
skills at each rung right if you don't
have any of those three at the next
level you can't move up right and so i
had two parts of my ladder super high up
built but my beliefs weren't there which
is why if you've heard any of my stuff i
focus so much on the beliefs because for
me they were the things that really made
such a big difference in my life and so
once i was able to grab on that was like
six levels of belief up that i was able

13
00:12:00.000 --> 00:13:00.000
to level up almost overnight and it was
because of that there was a number of
other things but that was one of the big
the big ones
that's powerful man
i feel like uh
i'm sure you had a similar belief change
now going on to acquisitions.com right
yeah
yes
same kind of process just at a different
level um
guys this is
what alex is saying like he he practices
what he preaches like
for example we were at
out to dinner together and you told me
to change
the story that i was telling myself
around a certain belief
like now i don't say that ever
i'm like i'm i don't identify with that
at all and then it just things just
shift things just open up
so all right next question
um
guys can we just like
show alex some love drop some ones drop
some ones i'm loving this question like
i have a round of applause this guy yeah

14
00:13:00.000 --> 00:14:00.000
this guy's a uh a philosopher of
business and life which brings me to my
next question
we figured we'd ask you some difficult
questions what's your philosophy on
death
um
actually i think i have a fairly simple
philosophy on it so i think everyone
here has been dead so i feel like i have
experience firsthand
in saying this because all of us were
not alive at some point we just say we
weren't alive rather than saying we were
dead but if you change the word it
becomes pretty simple right so we were
dead before we were alive and i know
that for me my experience of being dead
before i was alive was not that bad and
so i think that my experience of being
dead will return to be what it was when
i wasn't alive
that's my view i know that's i know that
a lot of people probably disagree with
that and that's you know my intention is
not to trigger anyone that's just been
that's my perspective
how does that allow you to operate in
business
differently or does it not even affect
you at all it's a great follow-up
question it's absolutely been one of the
things that has helped me most in
business
so
a lot of times i think that as

15
00:14:00.000 --> 00:15:00.000
entrepreneurs like we're exposed to
different levels of stress or rather
perceived stress because it's really
just stimulus right and then we choose
to become stressed about it based on the
stories that we tell ourselves about
what this stimulus means right our ad
account got shut down that is a stimulus
we don't need to be stressed but we
choose to be stressed right
and so
if we tell a different story or realize
that in a hundred generations no one's
going to remember who you are and your
bloodline's going to disappear because
it's going to be married through 100
times um then then all of a sudden
things matter less right and i can tell
you that my genuine first response to
any stressor is like my internal
dialogue is immediately when we die
nothing happens
and for some people that's very
frightening and whatever but for me it's
very calming and so if something crazy
happens like hey no matter what when i
die nothing's gonna happen they're gonna
throw dirt on my face and then it's
gonna be over right game's up out of
coins and so um for me that helps me
focus and make more reasonable and
rational decisions which i think most of
us that all we can really ask for is to
be able to make decisions well
um and try and limit to the best of our

16
00:15:00.000 --> 00:16:00.000
abilities the things that will detract
from our decision-making process
that's powerful man that's really
powerful
are you enjoying these questions trying
to give you questions you don't you
normally don't get i don't know these
are definitely unique for sure we can
talk about making money if you guys want
but i'm good with that no no no i like
this i like this
like for example henry asked why did you
pivot your model from paid ads to cold
outbound but like you just did a youtube
video on that so i was just going to
tell them to go check it out
yeah um
i mean i can talk about it if you guys
want
i'll give you i'll give henry i'll give
you a two minute answer all right okay
cool so when i look at so there's six
ways of acquiring customers right paid
earned owned media hopefully you guys
are familiar with those three and then
you have manual outbound affiliates and
referrals when i look at the biggest
companies in the world almost all of
them unequivocally are focused on manual
outbound affiliates and referrals as
their primary ways of of acquiring
customers with the exception of consumer
products right those are become but then
when that happens you really become a
media company right in conjunction with
exceptional product that has strong word

17
00:16:00.000 --> 00:17:00.000
of mouth and so for us especially in the
b2b space
many many that i see especially people
starting out function as though they are
a traffic business
rather than a service business if you're
catering to a niche you're going to have
a very strong
i'll rewind real quick
so of the five
of the six ways of getting customers
five of them are linear in nature
meaning you have the fixed ratio you get
five to one you get ten to one right for
every dollar every increment you get a
set or fixed increment back it
diminishes as you scale but you have an
increment that is somewhat fixed right
with one exception word of mouth
referrals is quadratic
one person tells two people two people
to four people four people eight people
and what most people don't realize is
that that quadratic expansion is
happening no matter what every day it's
just whether or not that quadratic
expansion is hindering
your business and is acting against you
or whether that quadratic expansion is
happening for you so the reason we made
36 dollars for every dollar that's when
that we spent is because we had so much
expansion through that one channel that
we were able to make so much money back

18
00:17:00.000 --> 00:18:00.000
and in that first year that i was
referencing we made a hundred to one
return on our advertising
and it was because we focused on some of
the other things and as as you know i'll
even i'll even give this as an example
so
did anybody hear of this book before i
got on the call today
anybody see like their newsfeed and
stuff most people probably got it
already okay maybe
the point is is that um
this is this this book was somewhat a
test of what i'm trying to do now um
which is
i wanted to see if i could make a
product that was was
was good enough that people would market
it for me
and who would not need affiliate
commissions but would would would tell
their audience about it because of the
intrinsic value that it would provide
for some to buy it you know and so right
now this book this book sells a thousand
copies a day
and so if you guys are familiar with
like free plus shipping funnels a
thousand copies a day is a significant
amount of copies right
and that's all done with no advertising

19
00:18:00.000 --> 00:19:00.000
and so
when when people are looking like now
when i'm looking at the businesses that
i want to acquire i'm looking at how
much how much of am i going to get
because the compounding interest comes
from the one-time investment of the
product
how good can we make our service how
good can we make our product and most
people spend all their time on the
promotion and many of you may not may
have already heard this but you still
don't do it
because it's simple not easy
the amount of time extra time it takes
to go from good book to great book and
the amount of extra time it goes from
great book to a remarkable book remark
worthy share a bowl because it is so
valuable is is vastly different but from
a one-time investment i now can yield
compounding returns and when i look at
the people who make significantly more
money than me they don't do anything
that has linear exchanges
they're like why would i want to run a
marketing campaign because then i'm
gonna have to do it again next month
it'd be so much easier to just get a few
customers to get it enjoy it
and then just let them go do all the
work for me
and so here's a here's a question
that'll hopefully uh mind [ __ ] a couple
people

20
00:19:00.000 --> 00:20:00.000
so let's say that i was uh joel kaplan
god of marketing right
um and i i
forbid you some way through my marketing
powers right i stop you from acquiring
any more customers than you currently
have all right so think about that for a
second so everybody your client roster
is all you have
what would your client experience
and your product
need to look like
in order for
referrals
from those customers to be the only way
for you to grow
what would the client experience need to
look like for only your customers to
bring you more customers is the only way
for your company to grow
you probably think about it differently
right
is there anything different than what
you're currently providing right now if
that was the only way you could get new
customers
alex do you want to come coach and the
thing is if you fix that
and the thing is if you fix that right
you'll get the infinite returns on your

21
00:20:00.000 --> 00:21:00.000
advertising because then you won't need
to spend that much money acquiring
customers because every customer comes
pre-loaded with 10 other customers in
them
right and so if you fix the product then
all the marketing efforts you put in
yield those crazy returns
but everyone gets it backwards they
think that if they learn to promote
that's how they're going to make money
you can make a little bit of money
learning how to promote but you make a
fortune learning how to make a product
so you need to have just enough
promotional experience to get it out
there
and then after that the product should
be able to do most the work and that's
where all the profit comes from because
your cost of acquisition is zero
alex can i ask a devil's advocate kind
of question yeah sure
do you feel like it's easier to be in
that space of long term and
being able to create something so good
that it promotes itself
after going through the experience of
learning how to promote of learning how
to put yourself out there of yeah kind
of forcing the momentum to happen as
opposed to letting it happen

22
00:21:00.000 --> 00:22:00.000
naturally like it's it's almost like i
was thinking about your book and i'm
like
of course it's being
uh of course it's blowing up but that's
also not your first book and it's also
it's not the first thing you've ever
written it's probably totally
you've written so many thousands of
words for on copy on ads that have seen
you know what i'm saying but i don't
know if you totally
totally so here's how the process is
supposed to work
so the process is supposed to work is
that you learn enough promotion to fix
your product and make your product
exceptional and so it's here's a thought
example excuse me a thought experiment
imagine you're making this is the
subject of the book right is imagine you
made an offer that was so good no one
could say no let's say you said i'm
going to market for you for free and if
i don't make you money i'll pay you a
thousand dollars just like think just
for example all right just crazy
you probably wouldn't have a lot of
difficulty getting customers right of
course not
and so the question is on the other hand
you've got what most people do which is
pay me maybe get results maybe you don't

23
00:22:00.000 --> 00:23:00.000
either way you'll pay me i don't really
give a [ __ ] right and of course that's
not you guys it's your competitors right
um but you get the idea right and so if
this is the extreme where everyone says
yes and this is the extreme where it's
very hard to sell
how can i make this my offer because a
lot of people would say well [ __ ] i'm
never going to make any money well
you're only not going to make any money
if you don't provide any value if you
provide the value then the business will
explode right but if you don't know how
to provide enough value yet this will
give you enough flow
to fix the client experience to fix the
product so that you get to the point
where eventually you have word of mouth
referrals that are actually kicking in
and might be the majority of your
business and then you go back and you
jack the promotion but most people start
making some sales and then just jack the
promotion as their way of making money
when the reality is that's not how
you're going to make a fortune you'll be
able to pay yourself don't get me wrong
like there's plenty of marketers out
there who make decent money and it just
also depends on what your definition of
decent money is you know what i mean um
but the the plate the way the real
players play is they market enough to to

24
00:23:00.000 --> 00:24:00.000
figure out product market fit right do
people want what i have and is the thing
good enough that people stay and
continue to they do
yes cool i said you have to promote
enough
and then you fix the product and then
you go back to the promotion and you
jack the [ __ ] out of it
it's like what is
two huge things working for you like
what we say is you need clients to get
client results right you can't like
magically have an amazing product that
serves your clients and solves all
problems if you don't have any clients
to be able to
try or test that product or service with
100 um
but most people think that that testing
process is where they're going to make
their money that is how they act um
powerful stuff
i think uh
let's keep going let's see what else we
got
guys these are some great questions
whoever is dropping whichever one you
want
um
let's see

25
00:24:00.000 --> 00:25:00.000
all right billy asked if you were to
start a similar business all over again
and already had the foundations let's
say doing around 50 to 100k per month
how do you grow it to
a million a month and beyond as fast as
possible
you don't ask the question how do i do
it as fast as possible
step one
um
i actually had an acquisition.com
company who got through four or five
stages of our acquisition process
and the founder came to me and said how
can you guarantee that i'm gonna get to
a million dollars a month in six months
and i said you're out sorry
he's like what where i thought what and
i was like you're out man because if you
think that way you'll never get there
and so one of the things that stuck with
me from our convo is like alex does an
amazing job at taking a time horizon and
really stretching it out so instead of
like how do i hit this goal by the end
of the year it's like what if i could
hit it in 10 years
why do you care why does it matter why
do i have to hit it by like what what

26
00:25:00.000 --> 00:26:00.000
what is going to change right
it's like you're trying to
anyways so in terms of the actual what
happens what has to happen with the
business is that business has to be
better than it currently is so that it
provides more value than your and then
you're compensating exchange tactically
usually getting to about three hundred
thousand dollars a month um just comes
from promotions right
the
increase from three hundred thousand to
a million dollars a month comes from an
increase in lifetime gross profit this
is this is again
me making broad generalizations specific
to agencies that are probably selling
this is me talking to this audience i'm
not saying every business but for most
people who are in this audience to
getting from 300 to a million dollars a
month comes from increasing lifetime
gross profit per customer and you can do
that a number of ways right you can do
that because you decrease your turn and
you stop losing customers right simplest
way of doing it because here's
where's the hundred thousand dollar
month guy
uh billy
where is billy billy wilson yeah he's
right next to me on
can i unmute it can he unmute all right
how many clients do you sign up a month
right now

27
00:26:00.000 --> 00:27:00.000
uh in
various rounds between six and eight um
that's fine we'll just use let's just
we'll use seven all right actually
eight's a better number for
multiplication so we'll use eight all
right so you make eight clients a month
what's the average client pay-per-vote
2 500.
okay 2 500 bucks so
let's see here i think it works out to
like 16 months to get to
200 000. so you have so you have a
five-month ltv right per customer
currently
right
because it's 2500 if you're capped at
100k a month it means you can't go
beyond that because you're losing the
amount that you're gaining so you got
eight people who are leaving eight
people who are coming
is that about right
our turn's about six percent
okay that's not where we're capped right
now that's what we're we're not really
stuck there like progressively growing
but growing pretty slow yeah so i think
i think that our biggest problem just to
make sure we're on the same page is
probably like a fluctuation within sales

28
00:27:00.000 --> 00:28:00.000
right now and so we can hit six to eight
and then we'll hit a period where it
would just like tank
and then we can go a couple we can go
like a week or two with like one sale or
so
yeah
so if we were to phrase this is a
problem that needed to be solved so this
is just me executing what i was saying
earlier with the skills beliefs and
trait framework so it's
how do i make more consistent sales
right
and so obviously the simplest and best
way if you if you want to make a fortune
right billy this is me just talking to
you cause i know you commented on my
youtube so this
show some billy wilson love um
if you want to make a fortune you have
to figure out how you to not lose 50 of
your customers every year
like that's what you have to figure out
because you're just always going to be
running in this uphill term it's just
very difficult to make money when you're
losing half your customers right because
the only way to get there is to increase
acquisition and then if you're in a
niche it means you're going to burn
through the marketplace eventually
and then so if we're looking and we're
stretching this again we're stretching
the time horizon
the question is like how do we figure
out how we can not lose customers do we
need to change the customer do we need
to change the fulfillment it could be

29
00:28:00.000 --> 00:29:00.000
either of those things right that's the
real real right but if you want the
simple answer of like yes i want to get
two million a month you could get there
i don't know how long you'd sustain it
because eventually you would burn
through right but yeah you would
increase your acquisition and so um are
you getting mostly through paid ads
right now
yes
okay
so i'm guessing that when you spend more
and paid ads all of a sudden the roi
goes down and then that's why you can't
go does that sound right
yeah pretty much right
and so that's where i think that there's
that kind of concurrent advertising
campaign that might be happening against
you i'm not saying this is this is not
me casting sevens i'm just trying to
help um
and so
you will get more scale from your ads if
you have more positive word of mouth
like in a real way especially if you're
in a niche
right but yes the simple answer is do 10
times more than what you're doing right
now or get your people to stay three
times as long you know what i mean
because when you do that then all of a
sudden your back end profit starts
going like nuts and then the cost of
acquisition that right now seems

30
00:29:00.000 --> 00:30:00.000
unaffordable to you becomes affordable
again
100 agree
right
so like the lifetime gross profit per
customer for me is 28
500.
the average cost of acquiring most small
business owners in a niche is between
two and three thousand in ad spend if
you include the marketing team and all
the other things it might be closer to
four thousand right and that's at scale
right maybe five thousand all right and
so right now if if it costs you five
thousand dollars to get a customer and
your ltv and this is your lifetime
revenue is twelve thousand five hundred
but then you have the cost of
fulfillment et cetera so you're already
at 7 500 after you take your cost of
acquisition out and then you have
whatever is left in terms of fulfillment
right
and so then there's just not a lot left
over right it's not you know
and no one makes a fortune on two to one
and three to one
like you make a fortune on twenty to one
thirty to one like that's where you make
like the money money and so for me if
you guys want a belief that you can
borrow for anyone who's on here if you
find this interesting like i won't

31
00:30:00.000 --> 00:31:00.000
really try and scale a business until
i'm at least at 20 to 1.
i'm just sharing my world view you can
do with it what you want but i want to
keep fixing what i'm selling and what
i'm providing in order to get there
and then once i'm there then i know that
i have the lifetime of profit to support
an aggressive acquisition process
actually a really good point i find that
really funny because i feel like my
biggest strength is product
i'm not the best natural sales guy
but i think i see other people and like
maybe it's like that social media aspect
you see this guy you know they just say
they get a million dollars a month in 12
months or whatever
but
and because of that i think i've been
focusing too much
on that and trying to grow fast and
focusing on something that's not even my
strength
when the other way actually ends up
working better
from what you're telling me at least
so what if he makes a million dollars
how does that affect you it doesn't
exactly right it doesn't do anything
and like again and what people like i

32
00:31:00.000 --> 00:32:00.000
can't tell you there's this lady reached
out to me and she's like hey alex i'm
catching up to you i'm doing a million a
month now and then i and then for some
reason she asked me for help for
something i said send me a screenshot of
your of your financials
and so she sent me her financials and
she was doing 300 000 a month in cash
collected and a million dollars a month
in contract revenue but never actually
collected and never got above three
hundred thousand dollars a month of cash
collected but she's marketing herself as
doing a million dollars a month every
single month that she never has she's
doing like three or four million bucks a
year right and so the thing is like
yeah what it really depends on how you
if she says contract collected yes you
should say that but
point is um it just doesn't affect you
right like it literally never affects
you and this is this is a hack for
anybody who's curious
go to your news feed and hide all of
your competitors so you stop seeing
their
i don't see anyone's ads people like how
are you responding other people i'm like
i'm not i have no idea what they're
saying
this is not helpful
it makes you feel terrible when you see
other people's ads
so why i look at them everyone's your
[ __ ] day

33
00:32:00.000 --> 00:33:00.000
so yes if you look at the guy you can
still always learn from somebody who's
ahead of you right and so that person
might be better at sales you can
probably learn from them about the sales
process and if you combine that with
your better product then you'll make
more money than they are and then
they'll ask what do i need to learn from
billy
which is how the process i believe
should work
but in the marketing space we are
promotion heavy by and large because
we're promoters right
but the guys who make the most money are
the ones who have good problem
alex here's a good uh question
from zachary yeah
what's your verdict on doing work or
what are your thoughts on doing work
that you find fulfilling
versus doing work for the sake of money
and
i know that
well i'll let you answer it
what what
yeah no because i just had a long
conversation with a a friend of mine who
just sold this company for 180 million
and i asked him same question i said how
do you create and destroy meaning and

34
00:33:00.000 --> 00:34:00.000
work and he said he just paused and
looked at me and he was like why do you
think work needs to be meaningful
and then
right and then i asked him and i was
like well then how do you you know
create meaning in life and he was like
why do you think life needs to be
meaningful
and i was like
all right
cool reset
nihilist philosophy over here
i do have one question though to that
point so this is interesting what about
all the brands who have [ __ ] products
but have the market share they're making
the most money like mcdonald's has a
[ __ ] product but they don't have a [ __ ]
product
they don't have a [ __ ] product
well the product rides incredibly fast
it's very tasty it's incredibly
affordable it's consistent as [ __ ]
across every single marketplace they
have a drive-through that's available 24
7.
like how is it a shitty product
okay i see i see i see what you're
saying yeah then that and maybe that's
like you don't want to eat it but it
doesn't mean that the with the vast
majority of people the population values
the product clearly sure
sure but i i think if there are

35
00:34:00.000 --> 00:35:00.000
definitely examples of brands
in different niches where
there are people who have the market
share who don't have the best product
you know they might okay so they may
maybe they don't have a [ __ ] product but
they definitely don't have the best
product and so they usually
so in the beginning i said with the
exception of consumer products
but if you're but in this audience if
we're going b to b high ticket services
which i'm pretty sure
that's what everyone's here is doing
right
yes guys who are going to make the most
money the ones who who provide the most
results right
and correct and really results is second
to perceived results which is what do
they think they're achieving like you
might be like this guy made ten to one
but if he doesn't perceive that value
he's not going to value it
you elaborate on the exception for
consumer products
yeah so
like let's think let's say you've got a
meme t-shirt right

36
00:35:00.000 --> 00:36:00.000
something like that might be a traffic
arbitrage move right or you're selling
nutraceuticals right and you've got a
massive affiliate base
um and it really you know you've got 16
upsells for all the different bundles
and again it's just traffic arbitrage
that's when those become media companies
they're not really product companies or
media companies but again
that company would be 10 times the size
if the product is truly exceptional
because i think it's like it's this
there are if you talk to 10 different
billionaire entrepreneurs you'll get 10
different answers about how to make
money and it's usually going to be based
on the thing that they're naturally good
at right so there's going to be national
promoters you'll be natural product
people like different capital allocators
like there's different ways of winning
right and so
they're all necessary
different businesses will emphasize
different aspects of it
right some guys who are naturally
amazing promoters
um will will have the vast majority of
their sex as a result of their excellent
promotion right
some guys who are amazing at product
will have the best majority of their sex
from excellent product right

37
00:36:00.000 --> 00:37:00.000
but if you have both you will make not
just twice as much money but you'll make
10 times more money
yeah i don't think you're saying don't
do paid ads or don't market and just
shut off oh you need to promote the
product you need to promote the product
you're saying that
by promoting it and having an amazing
product that's how you create the
flywheel effect to really take things to
a whole new stratosphere yes
so like i could give everyone here the
really simple answers that everyone
probably wants right hey guys if you
would like to go from three hundred
thousand two million dollars a month
sell three times as many people or make
the clients three times more valuable
those are really your two options the
question is which of these is going to
produce more profit if you make them
three times more valuable you'll be
infinitely more profitable than if you
just try and triple down on your
acquisition because your cost of
acquisition is going to go up with scale
so your marginal shrink as you get to
that higher revenue level but now you
have all of these bodies you must
support and as billy was voicing earlier
sometimes your ad account gets shut down
sometimes you have a campaign that
doesn't work out and then all of a

38
00:37:00.000 --> 00:38:00.000
sudden you're on shit's creek because
you're you're walking this knife's edge
it's a far more sustainable way to grow
by improving the product and so this is
me giving you like what i believe having
taken a lot of the steps in this
direction um is the long-term answer
like if i'm going into a business now
someone asked like if you were to start
over again i would focus all my time on
making sure the product was exceptional
that's my actual answer it's probably
not what you want to hear but that's my
actual answer
let's see
let's see what was the last oh
meaningful work yeah
alex just as a little side note
like at the beginning when i started the
journey like i was trying to get all
this
self-worth and happiness out of the
business and that's like extremely
dangerous because as soon as the
business sucks then you feel like [ __ ]
about yourself
and inevitably the business is going to
go through ups and downs
so i've i've come to realize that work
can be meaningful but it's absolutely

39
00:38:00.000 --> 00:39:00.000
but it's more something necessary that
you do
so anyways so i think yeah yeah so it's
to round about answer the question i
think that if
if you can get to a position this is
just me sharing my two cents you guys
can take it to leave it um but for me if
you can if you can view your work as art
and art exists for no outcome but only
because you believe it should exist
and so if your work satisfies those
checklists then you will not need this
how do i guarantee a million dollars a
month by 12 months you won't need that
because there's there is no outcome
that's needed because you're doing it
for the sake of doing it right now
jeff bezos talks about this but he's
like everything has overhead
like the the chief justice in the united
states supreme court has probably had
that as their dream for a long time
there's probably also aspects of being a
supreme court justice that they do not
like and so i think in expecting there
to be all good and no bad is silly it's
also silly because we're we're upset

40
00:39:00.000 --> 00:40:00.000
about the human condition how like this
is great for marketing it's terrible for
being a human are you hungry
are you ever tired
are you anxious sometimes it's like the
beginning of every ad which really just
means are you a human being
do you experience emotions
of course you do
it's only because we expect that we
shouldn't that we feel like there's
mcdonald's is the answer right
mcdonald's is the answer right it's only
because we think that
and again for those who are on it like
billy right you may because you see
other people achieving more feel this
deficiency where you're like why am i
not better i suck
right and here's the crazy part desire
is great for achievement it should be
for feeling good
but i think there's a balance
and so i think when you extend the time
horizon you decrease the pressure you
make better decisions
because the unreasonable question or the
the the so clear it would be
unreasonable that it that it doesn't
happen is

41
00:40:00.000 --> 00:41:00.000
or the question that i would want to
answer if i were you is how do i make
the product so good that every time i
sign someone up they stay and bring a
friend
what do i need to do for that to happen
once i solve that problem
all of the strategies will work and it
will be inevitable that i will get to a
million a month
whereas the other guy might hit his
million and never hit a million a month
until he changes the way he does
business but yes to everyone sure you
can 20x your ad spend and get 20 times
the sales team
if you want to do that you're welcome
too but i'm
i wouldn't recommend it
that has overhead too though
it does
for sure emotional overhead as well
um this is a great follow-up question
that chris asked what do you replace
desire with
i don't think you should replace desire
with anything i think you should just
pick the things that you desire
carefully because
i mean i like naval ravicon's quote
which is desire is a contract we make
with ourselves to be unhappy until we
get what we want
and so it's like i'm writing a contract
i'm signing in blood that i'm going to
be unhappy until i get this thing so

42
00:41:00.000 --> 00:42:00.000
it's like we should be careful about
what we want to sign that contract for
again this is why like if i can extend
the time horizon that i don't create the
expectation and if i can make my work
into play and make it into art then all
of a sudden like
i have no expectation of the work
what's it this isn't a ball
oh well that one quote says yeah
it's a powerful quote i'm gonna go look
it up later yeah
which i actually heard that he got from
a blog that ended up getting deleted now
he takes credit for it but anyways the
point is that i heard it from
it doesn't matter it is what it is we
can give you credit alex it's all good
let's see
kara asked a really good question
earlier i can't find it because it was
so far up but i'm gonna ask it a little
bit differently
this is like what is a tactical
trend or opportunity or technology
that you feel most people aren't taking
advantage of that they should that is
not improving the product

43
00:42:00.000 --> 00:43:00.000
so let's give something
that is definitely shiny
like what is like a technology or like
like i know you just got on tick tock
like what is something like that that
you're like like what's something that's
like this is a opportunity that most
people aren't hopping on that you feel
like will take over or starting to take
over
to grow our business
i mean if you're watching i mean not
that everyone here watches what i'm
doing but um i mean i just got on tick
tock like two days ago um
and uh we started youtube probably six
or seven months ago like more seriously
actually probably very end of last year
beginning of this year um
i think that those platforms are very
good if you have something to say i
think those i think there's a lot of
attention on there but there's that that
caveat is big
comma if you have something to say and i
think that a lot of people
shouldn't really say anything it takes a

44
00:43:00.000 --> 00:44:00.000
lot of time
it takes a ton of time a lot of
attention and i remember when i started
gym launch
i used to tell all the gym owners in our
community i was like stop [ __ ] making
content i was like just run ads right
just run ads
and um and the reason isn't because i
don't believe in order organic content i
just believe that it's an overarching
strategy to recommend to somebody 95 of
people aren't good enough
for a variety of reasons they might not
have accomplished what is is worthwhile
to accomplish uh they might not be able
to communicate in a way they might not
be entertaining they might not be
attractive enough or interesting enough
whatever it is there's a lot of things i
think that have to go together in order
for it to become a worthwhile activity
and then even if it is a worthwhile
activity for you it will still take a
year two years three years for it to
really start paying dividends and so for
everybody who's got rent this month
you know i think there's a balance
between investment and consumption i
right now i'm at a point where i can go
hardcore to investment i can give the
book away for a dollar i can make the
courses free because for me it's the
long game of like i'd like to have
entrepreneurs who are doing 5 million or
more come to me in the next year two
year three years

45
00:44:00.000 --> 00:45:00.000
and i think that it'll probably be a
really good business
but i just i'm not in a rush
and i think people will ask me once once
we do a billion dollars a year in
portfolio revenue like how did you do it
and i'll be like i don't know we just
figured it would be reasonable that if i
invested in a lot of companies that were
growing and had good executors then we
would make money
it seems reasonable so what's the shiny
object alex
i don't have a shiny object
oh man i don't i can't tell you had all
the answers
that is the happiness most of the stuff
like let me
give you guys a real talk all right so
the companies that we have in our
portfolio right now the smallest one is
eight million dollars a year all right
so i don't know where everyone here is
at but just for context
the vast majority of the conversations i
have with the ceos the founders of those
companies
is me telling them to stop doing [ __ ]
and keep doing the thing they're doing
and get better marketing is about
different business is about better
business is about boring repeat
successful actions right that is the

46
00:45:00.000 --> 00:46:00.000
thing and most people don't want to do
that because it is hard it is so much
easier to hop into a new niche so you
can have that short term ego boost
feeling of adrenaline of something new
and exciting but that's because you lack
the character trait of persistence and
perseverance and focus and patience
and so that always becomes the limiter
and so it's like we have to keep i have
to keep hitting on that and what's funny
is that
speed feels slow when it's focused
so when i so there was a company that i
took on um that was doing just they were
doing they had two companies they're
doing 1.6 and 500 000 all right between
the two companies
i told them to shut down the the 500 000
one
and then we went all in on the 1.6
million one twelve months later uh they
just had their first two hundred and ten
thousand dollar a week so they just
didn't eight figure runway last week
it's 14 months all right
the entire time when we get on the phone
he's like hey man i know i know this
should be happening faster i know this
should be happening faster
and he went from basically zero

47
00:46:00.000 --> 00:47:00.000
to a million dollars a month in that
period of time
because it feels slow when it's focused
because it feels he's like dude this is
like really straightforward i'm like
yeah but most people [ __ ] it up
let's were like hey i started to make a
million dollars i should do this other
thing now too it's like or you should do
more of that thing
and so i think that if i'm being really
real i think the
most people don't know what the problem
is that they're trying to solve
so like all of us said the same time and
we have access to the same resources of
information and internet right everybody
here has the same resources so if one
person is growing faster than someone
else it means that they're solving
problems at a faster rate and it might
not mean because they're working harder
it just means that they're identifying
the problems faster and most of speed
comes from minimizing mistakes more than
maximizing returns
which is why the wealthiest investors in
the world are always mitigating downside
risk first rules of making money don't
lose money right first rules of business
momentum don't [ __ ] make mistakes
don't do new [ __ ] right you want to do
new stuff obviously but you get my point

48
00:47:00.000 --> 00:48:00.000
here right is that it's the shiny object
that will kill you and it's hard because
that's the character trait that got us
into business and then as soon as it
gets us into business we have to unlearn
it
how do i see mistakes ahead of the time
i think comes from pattern recognition i
think that my single greatest wishing
for a while
pattern recognition exactly it's like
i've seen you doing this like how when
did you start your first business it was
a decade ago
yeah and just for everybody's context
here so i don't know how long you guys
have been in business but like you guys
are all probably ahead of where i was at
whatever time duration you're in
all right so like i didn't really start
making what i would consider like real
money
until i was
five years into business and like i
basically almost made nothing for the
first five years
so i don't know how many years of
business you are in right now but like
if you're you know at half a decade it's
like all right now you can start making
some some money but like i didn't take
home more than 50 or 60 grand for four
or five years

49
00:48:00.000 --> 00:49:00.000
so i think you spot the i think you spot
it by trying to like it's the hardest
thing in the world is discernment right
it's the one wish that i ever have is
that i just want to be wise i want to
make good decisions and i think that a
lot of wisdom is seeing what people
can't see
and so it's like all right we have this
problem and then i try and think like
what questions am i not asking
and so if there's a bottleneck because
the simple answer for everything right
if you guys want to chunk up knowledge
right there's two ways to grow a
business you get more clients you make
them worth more
that's it
that's all there is
if you want to get more clients there's
six ways to get customers which i talked
about earlier right earned owned paid
manual affiliates referrals pick one
right get really good at it
if you want to increase the lifetime
gross profit per customer you can
increase the price you can decrease the
cost you can get them to buy more times
you're going to get more upsells you can
get more cross sales or you can have
down cells there's the six ways you
increase lifetime gross profit and so if

50
00:49:00.000 --> 00:50:00.000
i'm looking at this as a grid and this
is literally what we do at every
quarterly meeting with our company is
i'm like okay
how am i going to increase the number of
customers we have and how am i going to
make them worth more and we pick one
priority for each of those goals and
sometimes we don't pick any for the back
goals or any for the front goals we just
want to focus on one side and if you saw
the goals that we have for our companies
you would laugh because they're
hilariously simple it's like all right
well we averaged
20 you know 20 new customers from paid
ads a week on that channel
uh let's see if we can average uh 23 a
week for next quarter it's a 15 bump do
we think that's reasonable what do we
need to get a 15 pump all right well we
can increase our ad spend in these ways
we can do this new platform or we can do
x y and z and let's say i think x y and
z has the highest likelihood of actually
being right and so i think that one of
the things that you also start to
develop is i think when we're starting
out we have this illusion that
everything we do is going to work and
that this thing is going to be the
savior this thing is going to be the

51
00:50:00.000 --> 00:51:00.000
silver bullet when i think so much now
i'm so much more grounded in reality of
like ah
that could work
but am i sh would i bet that it's going
to work would i bet my life that's going
to probably about my life on it so i try
and just go with sure bets it's like i'd
rather take the 15 bump on something
that i already know than think of some
home run and i feel like i see the new
guys it's just like lottery tickets with
poor people it's like everyone they
always buy the lottery chickens they
think this is their way out when in
reality if they just dollar cost average
of the s p they'll guarantee that
they're going to get there eventually
yeah alex like i said if you're
interested in coming once a week
feel free just as an open invitation my
friend
if you ever want to if you ever feel
like you just need to let something out
we can we can be there to support you
all right let's and then um i have a
question that i'll i'll text you later
but um
let's see
these are just so are you guys digging
this i know this is

52
00:51:00.000 --> 00:52:00.000
guys if you're not if you're not taking
this so heavily this is so guys if
you're not taking that
like what would your client experience
have to look like
free to only grow through referrals is
the only way to grow
how do we keep more customers and make
them more valuable how do we get 3x more
customers and make them 3x more value
like
valuable like guys if you're not taking
notes like these are just a few of mine
like you're missing out big time
so i'll say this again for you guys and
this will be the subject of book six of
the book series but increasing lifetime
gross profit right i said six ways and i
said i'm fast so i'll say it again for
you so you can make sure you write it
down way number one is you increase your
price
number one
number two
you decrease your costs
of direct fulfillment
number three you get them to buy more
times which within the context of a of a
recurring business is decreasing churn
number four
you increase upsells which is buying
more of the same thing so if i have a
small coke versus a large coke that is
an upsell if i sell fries with my coke

53
00:52:00.000 --> 00:53:00.000
that is a cross-sell which is number
five there's a cross-sell if i sell an
additional service if you're selling
lead working in additional to lead gen
that is a cross-sell if i get you to
double your ad spend so that we can get
you more customers that is an upsell
it's more of the same versus uh
different right and the reason we
delineate these things is that if we are
precise with our words and our thinking
uh sorry if we're precise with our words
we precisely are thinking and you have
to be precise with your thinking
otherwise you'll have vagaries and your
clients and your employees will not
understand you when you want to execute
and the final way is figuring out some
sort of downsell process so that you can
still maximize no's into yeses all right
in order of importance
i would say cost and price are number
one and number two
and number three with uh increasing
increasing churn the left side the first
three are more important than the back
three
but they're still all important
tell us about book six wait there's five
or six
just give me ten books

54
00:53:00.000 --> 00:54:00.000
no i meant yeah
then another the five was it five or six
there's six increasing prices upsells
upsells cross sales down cells upsells
crosshairs down sales are the back three
and then you've got increased price
decrease cost and you get people to buy
more times
cross else missed that one
got it
um
i want to ask uh let's see
so when you're looking at your business
while he's thinking about the question
if i'm looking like i'm giving you
lenses that i that we make decisions
with because ultimately if i can give
you the decision-making frame then you
can make the decisions for yourself
because we wouldn't be able to hop on
with every single person make the
decision for you but if you have the
framework you can apply it so if you are
looking at your business and you're
doing okay i'm going to give you a math
equation that i use more than everything
in my entire life all right which is
what i did with billy i look at sales
velocity times lifetime value that will
give my extrapolated hypothesis max all
right so what that means is let's say um
so he said he was doing eight right
eight sales a month all right that's
what his average is and you said that's
we did last month so what i would

55
00:54:00.000 --> 00:55:00.000
probably do is i would say give me the
last six months and average it out
because that might have been last month
but what's the average maybe it's five
whatever but then you get reality all
right not your best month not what you
emotionally target in your brain but
what real real is right
so
i have my number of sales and then i
multiply that by my lifetime values
that's lifetime revenue all right not a
lifetime gross profit which is what i
was talking about earlier but lifetime
revenue all right and so for them and
the way that everybody here know how to
get lifetime revenue on a customer
it's priced divided by churn so you use
twenty five hundred dollars a month
divided by six percent
that's how you do it that's the lifetime
gross profit right now billy i don't
think that's accurate because if it were
accurate then it mean that you guys
would be growing like crazy
so i think that eight to eight velocity
might be incorrect
right because if you're if you're like
slowly growing itty bitty then it might
be closer to five new sales a month
because what happens is you approach
equilibrium it's an asymptote you
approach equilibrium

56
00:55:00.000 --> 00:56:00.000
and so
what i do with the business is i'm gonna
look and i'm gonna say okay what's the
price what's the churn that's the
lifetime gross profit my sales velocity
averaged over the last six months is
going to be five sales times lifetime
value right boom whatever that number is
eight times let's say 10 grand 80 grand
is where this business is going to cap
now if i'm doing 50k then i'm like okay
if i don't do anything i'm going to
continue to grow to 80.
now on the flip side if i do that math
based on my last month and i'm doing
100k and it says 80k it means i'm going
to shrink because i need to solve a
problem right and so the idea is how can
i play with these numbers so i can
project out where i'm going to bid so if
i want to triple it then i have my
equation i have my price i have my churn
and i have my volume and then you can
play with those and figure out which of
these things do i feel like is more
reasonable uh that i can change that
will get us to where i'm trying to go
and so what i'm trying and then once you
have which one of these dials you want
to fix then you just make what's a

57
00:56:00.000 --> 00:57:00.000
reasonable expectation that i think we
can do that if i had to bet my life on
it i think we could hit it
and if you make these 10 bumps 15 bumps
every quarter they add up very very big
very fast
but they feel slow and boring on the
inside
jasmine real quick um do you know if
we're opening it up to all agency lab
right now
yeah i'm going to drop the link right
now so they'll be hopping in
cool alex if it's okay with you i'm
gonna get him to buy the book again
all right
figured we'd add some value um thanks
man
guys
can i hear some takeaways from three
people three takeaways or one take away
from three different people
need to do better with delivering a
great product
who else
increasing the value of customers is
something we all could focus a lot more

58
00:57:00.000 --> 00:58:00.000
on rather than just getting more
customers we're always so obsessed with
more and more and more getting more and
more customers but
and that's how we got out of the hub we
were in last year increasing the value
of our customers and that the
cross-sells is such a great way to do
that and so many different things so
it's so so many takeaways i could like i
have so many con questions and so many
things to say based on everything you
just said alex does you can offer him 50
grand he's going to say no anyways if
you want if you want coaching so you're
pretty
you got his youtube channel
can i jeremy let me let me tell you a
story because i think what you said was
really important
so i did a so back when i did consulting
days a while ago um i've only done like
six so of one of those six i had an
entrepreneur who came in he was in the
exact same space as me so for those who
are concerned about competition i
literally coached somebody who's in the
same space all right
and um when we put his numbers on the
board he was selling the exact same

59
00:58:00.000 --> 00:59:00.000
number of units as we were
per month
and he was doing 300 000 a month and we
were doing 4.2 million a month
everyone's focused on the wrong [ __ ]
if you improve the back end the front
end's easy because if you make a hundred
thousand dollars on every customer who
gives a [ __ ] what the cost of
acquisition is and i'll tell you what
the cost of acquisition between most of
you guys is about the same
if you average it out because we own
allen the software so i see everyone's
numbers
most small businesses are required
between 1 and 3k that's just in terms of
ad spend right
so
that 1 to 3k range if that makes a
massive difference in the business
then you got to change the business it's
not the marketing
i i have a question for you um
just a quick question so are you using

60
00:59:00.000 --> 01:00:00.000
your own team to
create and publish your books or are you
working with like a firm or like a
company
i wrote the book
yeah but are you hi are you hiring your
own editors and designers and are you
just putting it on kdp yourself are you
using what are you using
i
[Music]
so i own
i own a chunk of a publishing business
and so i was able to use resources
within that business i the reason okay
very cool i ask because i have a
publishing my my agency helps people
write their books i've got team editors
and designers and then we
we our cross sells are like the video
the video books and audiobooks and pr
and the marketing and all the stuff so
guys um we have uh we have the full
agency lab community joining live right
now
guys um we had the rise mastermind
community first that was awesome
super excited now to have everyone on
here see some faces gavin see dante

61
01:00:00.000 --> 01:01:00.000
what's up dante hope you're doing well
steven freddy grant what's up guys
um
so oh we've got about 30 minutes with
alex
first things first though
i'm gonna do something fun
so
i mean maybe it'll
be fun maybe it won't be for you but
it'll be fun for me
uh
i need you guys to go on amazon right
now
and purchase the 99 cent it's one dollar
guys it's not actually it's not even a
dollar it's 99 cents go purchase alex's
book as a thank you for him hopping on
here
and taking the time to speak with us
today it's 99 cents
it's called 100 million offers
it's the purple book
i already uh i just bought the hardcover
earlier today i already had the
the kindle version
if you already have it drop a one
if you don't have it take a second go

62
01:01:00.000 --> 01:02:00.000
grab it
you're gonna absolutely love that book
hey joel can i can i happen real quick
so
now that everybody's here i can give you
guys a little bit of context because i i
don't think you asked the question but i
figure i'll tell everybody who's new
here so
um
for those of you guys who don't know us
we own acquisition.com right now our
portfolio company is about 1.6 million a
week
which is why i don't accept the 50k days
um
and
i
if you followed any of our stuff like
i i really yearn for trying to
do things that i drive joy from and so i
enjoy writing and i enjoy drawing
pictures around frameworks for thinking
and i do that because i enjoy doing it
for my own business and i would like to
share that with as many people as i can
and so
buying the book is awesome and i super
appreciate it what would be more
meaningful for me is if you could leave
a review
um that would be helpful and i'll tell
you the reason why is because
i think that
the the acquisition.com thesis or why i

63
01:02:00.000 --> 01:03:00.000
started the company or the portfolio of
companies
is that i think that the education
system in america is very fragmented or
really around the world right it's
failed most of us i don't know if you
guys went to college i did and i think
that i did not get my money's worth
and um
i think the reason that the entire guru
space as a whole has exploded is because
the demand for skills to feed ourselves
despite what the media will tell us
many of us want to work
people want to have skills people want
to provide value and there is a there is
a scarcity of people who can provide
that value and so
my goal is to help as many people as i
can
pay in donating my money
but more importantly or more valuably
donate the skills beliefs and traits
that i've acquired over my trajectory
that have helped me
and candidly
the money will only solve money problems
and then you'll still be left with
problems
that money can't solve but at the very

64
01:03:00.000 --> 01:04:00.000
least i think it gives most people space
and i think it gives a lot of people
meaning to be able to provide value and
so for me it would be very meaningful if
you help me uh with that um that mission
and so everything that i have in
acquisition.com is free um or a dollar
actually i think i'm gonna be able to
publish the book on my site for free so
it will be free soon um but amazon
doesn't let me do it for free so i have
to do a 99 cents and now it's just just
to like throw this in there the reason i
ask people to buy it first because i
believe you have to do that to be able
to oh yeah you have to you have to i was
just saying
just
in doing that i can i can end up
reaching a lot more a lot more people
but with the book there's also a course
that comes with the checklist and
downloads um and my my plan is to uh
release
uh 10 10 books with the courses
books two and three are already written
um and so are the and the courses have
been wireframed and i'll be releasing
those on a regular cadence uh and so
this is the first of those books because
it seemed to me to be the the problem
that most businesses suffer from
is that they're not actually selling

65
01:04:00.000 --> 01:05:00.000
something that people want and so uh
despite us all most of us being in the
marketing space at large uh
i have not found many books in the space
on product and so
i use the word offer but offer is one of
those interesting things that is the
bridge between the prospect and being a
client and it kind of occupies half its
ass is sitting on the seat of marketing
the other half of its ass sitting on the
seat of fulfillment and so um it kind of
bridges that gap so uh most people if
you simply improve the product will get
more leads they will make more sales at
higher prices uh simply by improving
that one thing and i think it was the
greatest level it's the first thing that
that someone has to fix and so when i
started writing the books i actually
wrote the third book first the second
book second and the first book third
because then each time i wrote it i was
like ah [ __ ] they actually need this
first and i wrote that one i was like
actually they need to have the offer
right if they don't have that then they
can't do leads and if they can't get
leads then they can't do money models
they can't do money models i don't need
to talk about sales they can't do sales
i can't talk about sales teams right and
so that's the first five books if you
guys are curious um
so anyways i just want to say thank you
joe for having me um for what's new for

66
01:05:00.000 --> 01:06:00.000
everybody who who's who's not new thanks
for listening to me again
guys um for those of you guys that were
with us for the first half we were doing
rapid fire well not rapid fire but just
q a with alex and uh
alex would you be cool with us just
continuing with some q a for the last 20
or 30 minutes
the show
all right let's do it um talking about
offers talking about product uh someone
asked a little bit ago
how would you
improve the
product
aside from just making the client more
money
i believe george has asked us and i
think more so it's like how do you
improve the way you see the perceived
value because we all have the client we
made a lot of money and then they quit
right totally no so um
there are so i mean
this is the core of the book all right
so
most people talk about value

67
01:06:00.000 --> 01:07:00.000
i haven't seen value defined anywhere
which is why it bothered me and so
inside the book i talk about what i
believe to be the value equation
so the value equation has four pieces to
it
it's a fraction all right so if you can
imagine my screen being drawn in the
middle or if you have your notes draw a
line in the middle
on the top side of the equation you have
two factors the first is the dream
outcome all right so that is the thing
that they find desirable and what's
important is that the thing that you
think they find desirable may not
actually be the thing they find
desirable and that's what happens when
you start learning more about your
prospects you might think it's making
more money but they might not want to
trade some of the other variables for it
but just as a simple thought experiment
if i had to say hey i'm going to make
you a million dollars versus i'm going
to make you more handsome most men in
general get more status from wealth and
so for them they would most of the time
perceive making money as more valuable
which is why most products around making
money are by and large priced at a
higher price right and so from a value
perspective that is the first component
of value which is what is the outcome we
were delivering right the dream outcome
the second

68
01:07:00.000 --> 01:08:00.000
part of this is now the rest of these
are assuming that two products are
solving the same problem so if you and
somebody else in your space are both
helping someone get more customers to
make more money etc right and as a fine
line of nuance here you might have made
the customer money that you were talking
about but most agencies don't even sell
how to make money
they sell leads or they sell shows or
they sell appointments but they don't
sell how to make more money
interesting so there's a lot of other
things that you would do for someone if
you wanted to actually truly make sure
they made more money there's a lot more
problems that we would solve because
each of these problems that we saw in
the beginning just creates more problems
and so we have to solve the entire cycle
in order for them to get more value
so number one is dream outcome number
two is perceive likelihood of
achievement all right
so here's an example to illustrate this
concept of two things that are the same
deliverable where one is more valuable
than the other so let's say you're about
to get surgery all right let's say you
want to get you want to get some plastic
surgery your wife wants to get plastic
surgery you've got two surgeons you're
choosing from surgeon one

69
01:08:00.000 --> 01:09:00.000
is right out of medical school
this is the first surgery they're ever
gonna do
surgeon two this is their ten thousandth
surgery of this exact same surgery
which of them would you send your wife
to or spouse tip
right
the one that's done ten thousand
which of them would you pay more for
the ten thousand in fact you probably
asked this guy to pay you to do the
surgery right
and so in a very real way the perceived
likelihood of achievement between two
identical offers
confers value to the product
does that make sense
so the first two
parts of the value equation are what is
the thing we are selling what is the
outcome we were delivering and then what
is the perceived likelihood that when
they buy the prospect believes they're
actually going to achieve it
and so if we what most new marketers do
is they only focus on those first two
parts of the equations which is bigger
and bigger promises and claims more and
more testimonials bigger promises
testimonials promises testimonials right
that's what new marketing looks like

70
01:09:00.000 --> 01:10:00.000
the further longer my entrepreneurial
career i've gone the more i focus on the
bottom half of the equation these are
the detractors of value these are the
things that take away
the third so for bottom this is the
third component
is time delay
so between when i buy
and when i'm delivered the experience
that i was promised
so the easiest thing to do in a
marketplace if you want to be more
valuable is take the amount of time it
takes someone else to achieve it and cut
it in half
so when you ask are there other
components that you did besides making
money absolutely there are other
components of value right and so getting
the speed for them so a weight loss
example would be like if you were to
click a button and then immediately look
down at your abs and have a six pack
imagine how valuable that product would
be exceptionally valuable and it's just
an extreme example of what speed looks
like the reason amazon continues to gain
market share is that even though it is
an e-commerce platform
they continue to make it faster and

71
01:10:00.000 --> 01:11:00.000
faster and faster and faster and in so
doing confirm more value to the end
client even though the thing they are
delivering is identical
that is how much people value their time
and so if in a marketing agency example
i'll give you a simple one
if you compared to a guy down the street
let's say the guy down the street says
all right let's get you signed up right
and then it's going to take us 14 days
to get your spun up and it'll take you
another 14 days to start making your
first sales and start generating cash
flow and you'll probably be roi positive
at day 60 right
normal
now if you looked at that and said
imagine this
as soon as the person's credit card gets
run their phone rings to the prospect
that's hot within seconds
how amazingly more valuable would that
be even though it is the exact same
thing the only component that changed
was time
and so we can make our products and
services more valuable by shrinking the
time between when they buy and when they
get
the fourth and last component is effort

72
01:11:00.000 --> 01:12:00.000
and sacrifice our goal is to decrease
these obviously but to define these for
you effort and sacrifice are two sides
of the same coin effort are is things
that your customer must now do that they
were not doing before starting with you
that they do not want to do so these are
things that they're going to start doing
that they didn't do before that are not
enjoyable so for all of a sudden you
have to have them to start calling leads
that is a cost
that is effort
on the flip side sacrifice is things
that they weren't doing before that they
now must start other way around that
they were doing before that they now
must give up
so for example they might love to have
their friday afternoons off but now
you're telling them that they have to
have these times open
right so that is a sacrifice and so our
goal
with the products and services that we
deliver is to maximize the dream outcome
maximize the perceived likely that
they're going to achieve it when they
buy from us minimize the time delay and
minimize the effort and sacrifice so in
theory
the person would click purchase from you

73
01:12:00.000 --> 01:13:00.000
and immediately basically get money and
so our job as entrepreneurs is to
lubricate that path for them and do as
much of that work in advance
and the harder part is the bottom side
of the equation it also happens to be
where the competitive mode is best built
anyone can make promises
anyone can show testimonials and it's
saturated in this space
but few people can deliver results
quickly and effortlessly to the client
and that comes from operational skill
know-how and perceiving the problems in
advance and solving them in advance in a
multitude of ways
and solving them and this is a key point
in the way that your prospects would
like them to be solved
so i'll tell you a story to drive this
point home
when i was in the when i was in the gym
space and i had my own gyms
actually this is after we had the gyms
but this is a this is a project that we
did
we um
we had a whole bunch of people we were
trying to create a downsell right so
increase
the more nos into yeses so take sawdust

74
01:13:00.000 --> 01:14:00.000
and still make money from the people who
are otherwise saying no and so this is
what we did
when someone would say no to buying some
sort of weight loss package
we say hey susie
i love that you came in here today i
love that you had the courage to take
the first step it's the hardest part and
so i want to reward you for that even if
you don't work with us we still want to
give you value so if you're alright with
that i still want to give you a meal
plan still want to do nutrition
consultation and so hopefully you can
start losing weight on your own
and if you do and you like it
maybe you'll come back to us in the
future and even if you don't maybe at
least you'll say nice things about us
fair enough they'll say sure and they
would come back the next the next day
for a nutrition consultation
our average ticket in supplement sales
for people who said no to service and
then came back was 50 higher than people
who had already bought services so our
average ticket was 200 and something
dollars on on people who had already
bought and it was 300 plus mint theories
on people who had not bought services
and so it is not that these people did
not want to buy weight loss the dream
outcome

75
01:14:00.000 --> 01:15:00.000
they wanted to buy it in a way that had
less effort and sacrifice and perceived
less time delay
they didn't think they were going to
make it to the gym on some level but
they figured they could take the shake
and so it's not that the prospect didn't
want the problem to be solved they
didn't want it solved in the way we were
solving it
so that's the value equation and so if
you're thinking about your own
services that you're delivering i think
through those components and say like
how can i maximize and minimize each of
these so i can ultimately provide more
value to the marketplace
alex let's shift to a more philosophical
question
because no i feel like i feel like the
we in the for the past hour we did
philosophy business and it's been a
really good balance and it kind of just
all merges together is there anything
you regret alex
and follow up is there anything you fear
that you'll regret

76
01:15:00.000 --> 01:16:00.000
it's difficult because if i if i could
go back in time with all the lessons
that i have then yes i would totally
play things differently but
if i if i needed to make the mistake in
order to get the lesson then now so like
i don't regret where i am because i
think the the lessons were requisites of
being here so i have no regrets in that
sense were the mistakes that i made that
if i were presented with the same
situation again i like that identical
situation at this point would i respond
differently absolutely
do you feel like um
you've also you've obviously
accomplished a lot you've lived life
fully from what i guess from an
outsider's perspective is there anything
you feel like you haven't done
um
that you need to experience
not really i mean layla i mean
um
you know uh

77
01:16:00.000 --> 01:17:00.000
i think you have seasons of reaping and
selling you know and i think as long as
you enjoy both aspects of the season and
expect so it's kind of like the good the
flip side of good and bad right which is
one of the reasons i don't believe in
heaven and i hope this isn't offensive
to anyone but it's like hedonistic
adaptation would force us that if we
have something that's very good for a
long time we would get used to it right
and so then it's no longer good it's
just normal
and so like even bad things are
requisites of good things
so if you want good things to happen you
want ups you must by definition have
downs and so if both of them are
required for each other's existence then
we stop conferring the value of good or
bad to the good or bad things they are
just things
and i think that the more experienced
business owners that i see
um what i can tell you is a common a
common trait that i've at least
witnessed and all the guys that i know
that are worth 500 billion a billion
plus is that they're unbelievably steady
handed they're very calm they have very
long
lag times between stimulus and response

78
01:17:00.000 --> 01:18:00.000
so someone could blow up in their office
and they're like
well
that didn't go as expected
they're not reactive and so i think that
a lot of especially you know earlier on
in the entrepreneurial journey for many
of us it's like we have we have to take
tons of emotion to make these actions to
quit our jobs or put the stability or or
go out on our own um
and it's a character trait that we have
and then we have to
immediately unlearn those traits that
made us entrepreneurs
and like as a funny example for this a
lot of entrepreneurs especially as the
business grows don't want to become
corporate right they don't want to have
structure i don't want to have meetings
right
the reason every fortune 500 company in
the u.s has an hr department every the
reason every one of those companies has
labels and titles that everyone gets is
because those things matter to humans
and so we try and like not
we try and leave that space to start our
own thing and then once you scale enough
you realize that you go back to exactly
where you started because it was a

79
01:18:00.000 --> 01:19:00.000
requisite of getting there
but at least this time you got to make
the choice to come to the conclusion on
your own
i think um i think that's pretty
powerful
um
guys
what are some questions you guys have i
see a few below let me see
um
let's see what else i want to ask
we had so many good ones
i was so much more reactive in the early
years
you know client fires angry
clients
[ __ ]
yeah let me let me ask one let me ask
one on behalf of everyone that i get a
lot
and this is going to be different than
probably what most people are expecting
but i get the question all the time
which is uh you know what should i start
investing in what should i start
investing my money in right

80
01:19:00.000 --> 01:20:00.000
and um
i'm i'm pretty i'm pretty
pretty outspoken about this and i think
there's a difference between
entrepreneurs and employees right so if
you plan on having a career as an
employee then i think dollar cost
averaging and living as low you know as
cheapestly as you possibly can has been
a winning solution it's a simple
solution
for entrepreneurs because we have more
variable income and we can increase our
income
to a much higher degree based on our
skills our traits and our beliefs
it would be it's a it's a prudent
investment to invest in increasing your
skills traits and beliefs
and so i have we and we still do
consistently spend basically as much
money as we possibly can
on anything that will improve us as
entrepreneurs and so when someone's like
man i could cost average in you could
now but like
i never wanted to start investing money
because in some way for for me
beginning to invest money in like the
stock market and stuff
was me sort of relegating myself to
saying i don't think i'm going to make

81
01:20:00.000 --> 01:21:00.000
more money than i'm making now
and so i
i'm just telling you how i did it which
may not be for everybody and this is not
financial advice listen to your own
financial advisors but
for me i consistently spent pretty much
every dollar i had on mentors coaching
in courses and books
until i had more money than i know what
to do with and if you still have courses
and coaches and mentorships that you
wish you could have and you cannot
afford then that's what i would be
saving up for
because those things
in and of themselves one of them or two
of them might not be the thing
but a lot of specified or specific
knowledge trench knowledge nuance
knowledge comes from connecting
disparate things together and that's
where you create value
and so
i i like to liken this to a bridge
but let's say on this side of the screen
we've got where you are and on this side
you've got the outcome that you want
which might be more dollars right
each aspect of this bridge is these
little planks right are skills that are

82
01:21:00.000 --> 01:22:00.000
required and a lot of times someone will
read a book or they'll take a course
they'll go to a seminar and immediately
they won't make more money and they're
like what a failure
but the problem is that it's binary
thinking it's i was successful or i was
not successful rather than am i closer
to success now than i was before i
started
and i think that if most of us can
switch our thinking from binary to the
continuum which billy for what we were
talking about earlier if you're thinking
about your goal of i want to get to a
million dollars a month it's not am i a
million dollars a month or not and if i
am not i am a failure it's am i closer
because if you're consistently getting
closer you will at some point it will be
inevitable that you cross it
but it's only because we can remove the
component of time and simply think about
progress on a continuum
and so
what happens a lot of times is that
people don't understand or discern what
the limitation is that they have on
their business so a lot of people people
even here will continue to focus more on
marketing or copywriting or whatever it
is or traffic buying but that probably
or might not be the weak link in the
business
and in my opinion most businesses

83
01:22:00.000 --> 01:23:00.000
function like cars which is is is one of
the cylinders more important than
another or are cylinders more important
than wheels well you need both
and so just like you need marketing just
like you need sales just like you need
gasoline in the engine you need all of
the things to be successful which is why
it's so frustrating to be an
entrepreneur because you acquire a new
skill and somehow you put the cylinder
in and it still doesn't work but the car
is more likely or closer to becoming a
fully functioning car than it was before
and you could still use that continuum
concept on i'm now building another car
that is a bigger car so i built a bigger
engine but i still need bigger wheels
and bigger axis etc because i have the
engine of a of an of a v8 in the engine
but i still have the chassis of a pinto
right and so the the process is this
continuous pipeline that as soon as you
even out every aspect of the pipeline
you then go back to the front and then
jack it up again and then it goes to get
and then each aspect of it has to be
de-bottlenecked and a lot of that comes
from what i like you know it's not my

84
01:23:00.000 --> 01:24:00.000
sag but the the theory of constraint
which i'm a big advocate of which is
systems will grow until the constraint
and if you simply remove the constraint
they will continue to grow until the
next constraint but most people solve
problems that don't exist
and they put all their time
solving the wrong
problems and so most people outside is
simply prioritization from the inside
it's we only have a set amount of time
resources and skills that we can
allocate human capital we can put
towards problems which of these problems
is the biggest lever and that's where
the speed comes from but in terms of the
doingness of the business people can
only do so much and so the businesses
that move quickly are the ones that
prioritize the right things to do and
literally just ignore the wrong things
and i'll give you one small anecdote for
this to drive this point home we did not
send emails until we hit 50 million in
revenue
was it wrong
i don't know
but it wasn't the priority at the time
that i perceived as the biggest problem

85
01:24:00.000 --> 01:25:00.000
or the biggest lever or the constraint
on the business
and so i didn't email it to your own
list
yeah we didn't even do follow-up emails
someone opted in and applied they never
got an email
how do you only started emailing like
nine months ago
to try to simplify it for most people
that are here let's say between 0 to
100k a month
a little bit are farther some are
brand new
what would you say are the right things
to focus on and the wrong things to
focus on from a higher level obviously
email is a very specific example
yeah
how do you answer it from a higher level
it's one one one you have to sell one
product to one avatar and one channel
and that sounds so simple it's so simple
most people don't do it what's even
simpler is to not do it
so
i i feel like i have the conversation a
lot with new entrepreneurs like well i'm
starting this thing and i kind of have
you know we're dealing with
chiropractors but we're also dealing

86
01:25:00.000 --> 01:26:00.000
with physical therapists and one of
these is going to take
pick one both could work they're both
multi-billion dollar industries just
pick one the problem is that you haven't
picked and because of that you're never
good enough because there's not enough
you to go around to focus on solving the
tr the problems that truly matter
as a funny thought experiment
that's having two businesses
how many publicly traded ceos do you
know that are ceo of mcdonald's and ceo
of coca-cola
so yeah i'm managing both right now i'm
ceo of two different businesses elon
musk [ __ ] [ __ ] the only outlier
ever
anyways he's not the ceo he's the
founder they're ceos in each of those
companies right
um
but even then and that's the thing is
that most people
think
and the title doesn't matter we might
have to see what's functioning is he
that's not the he's not the operator
right
most people think that they are the
owners of their business
that is true but it's not the only thing
you are you're also a vp of sales you're

87
01:26:00.000 --> 01:27:00.000
also cmo you're also ceo you're also ceo
right you're also handling i.t
right and so what happens is you replace
one of your seven hats and then think
i'm good but you still have six of their
hats and so you have to replace every
single hat you have and making decisions
as an executive is also a hat
it's arguably the most important hat
and that's why you can't have
two of those hats for each company which
is why most people who are entrepreneurs
who are newer never [ __ ] make money
until they have to eliminate
parts that are taking their attention
which are usually side hustles extra
gigs the thing that they have to burn
the boats on so they can go on on the
main thing because your attention can't
be split
you delegate and reverse your order of
income victor
last last question and then i want to
respect your time i know we're out of
time um where do you see
the marketing agency space going over
the next 10 years over the next decade

88
01:27:00.000 --> 01:28:00.000
where do you see it going
ooh follow-up
best position yourself
that that shift yeah
most markets are
so
internet
technology con
hold on let me say this right
technology democratizes consumption and
consolidates production which means if
you're the best in the world you get to
do it for everyone and so
if
that's a
a paraphrasing about naval rava concept
which i like a lot
so right now
spaces are becoming increasingly
fragmented all right so what once was a
marketing agency for local businesses
now you've got you know a micro gym
agency and then you've got a big box gym
agency then you've got bar
gym agency and then you've got and so
the idea is that we have to micro new
niche down so that you can
envelope the customer in the more
complete solution
right
and so i think that the direction for

89
01:28:00.000 --> 01:29:00.000
marketing agencies or at least if you
want to win the marketing agency space
is going to be the one who provides the
most value and solves the most problems
which ends up becoming
half consultants
half agency because the problem that
most these guys have is not their legion
it's because their businesses suck right
and so we actually have to take full
responsibility for the outcome of our
customers and the only way to do that is
to be very specific on what types of
customers we serve so that we can be
very specific in our solutions the more
broad the customers we serve the less
specific we can be in our solutions and
instead of doing the less value provide
which means there's room for someone
else to exploit us and move in and be
more specific and then take that piece
of the market
and own it so i'll give you an example
it's taken five years for gym launch to
go from micro gyms so now we have a
second product line which is big box
gyms
singing five years
i love that seems like um the

90
01:29:00.000 --> 01:30:00.000
agencies that can be more of a hybrid
and solve more problems and lead gen is
just one component will ultimately win
it's value
it's all it is
leads is not that valuable leads are a
commodity
alex we do want to be respectful of your
time so last thing is there any other
final words you want to share
any plugs
i try to get as many people to buy the
book but anything you want to share you
know open floor
it's fine um
i think the vast majority of everyone on
here would be best served
if you did two things one is if you
extended your time horizon far past this
month or this year and if you just
thought
how can i provide so much more value to
my customer and the question that i
asked i think in the first half that i
don't think the people who are newer got
to hear but i will say it again
is that if if the marketing gods
prevented you from requiring new
customers
and the only customers you had were your
existing customer roster
in order to gain your customers

91
01:30:00.000 --> 01:31:00.000
what would the experience have to be
like for existing customers so that the
only way that you got new customers was
through them via referral
how different would your client
experience need to look like
what outcomes would they need to have on
what time frame how much effort and
sacrifice would you need to take off of
their plate so that they could be
successful
and so i think that most people think
they need to do something different
when the strategy of a marketing
agency is very simple
you get clients and you keep them a long
time and if you do that you'll make
money
the problem is making that happen is
hard but some people question the
original strategy
the reality is that most people are not
that good
if you are not making the amount of
money that you would like to make is
because you are not good enough
charlie munger said to have what you
want deserve what you want
the marketplace will tell you what you
deserve
so right now
if you are stuck at something it means

92
01:31:00.000 --> 01:32:00.000
that you lack a skill a trait or
character belief sorry a skill a trait
or belief
and so it's up to us and maybe ask other
people maybe ask your customers what
would be better how can i make this how
can i improve this for you
every single customer complaint is an
opportunity for you to solve more
problems
and if you look at them as those
opportunities eventually those problems
stop arising nearly as frequently
and then they become simply execution
issues rather than fundamental
deficiencies in the business that you
are lacking
so if you want to grow
marketing is about different business is
about better
damn
alex freaking appreciate you man i see
you as the bus not only as a mentor but
as a business and life philosopher and
uh every time i talk to you i just feel
more expansive so
uh no i mean that man i know you laugh
but i i really mean that from the bottom
of my heart
guys let's just show alex some love
let's do a round of applause on meet
yourself for one second so much

93
01:32:00.000 --> 01:33:00.000
thank you thank you so much
buy the book
you know there's a youtuber
if you guys like it yeah there's a
youtube channel comment on all your
videos now
[Laughter]
yeah so i i hope i'm not being an
[ __ ] i'll just squeeze one little
thing in i would love
i would love to hear what you're doing
to drive a thousand book sales a day is
that something you would be interested
in telling us a little bit about
yes
this will be a perfect finish it's fine
it's a perfect finish to the the point
here
i have no upsells i have no funnel i
have no paid advertising the reason the
book is selling a thousand copies a day
is because people are telling their
friends about the book
there's nothing else
there's literally nothing else i promise
you i'm doing nothing else to drive book
sales
you know it's funny because i asked alex
to do this
he didn't ask me to do this
to to bring him on here to

94
01:33:00.000 --> 01:34:00.000
talk about the book and
i was like yo alex i'd love to help you
so
no i appreciate it i'll tell you what
happened so in the last if you guys if
this is interesting to you so in the
last three weeks and i haven't made i
haven't really i've been very quiet
about what i've done for a long time um
and i haven't been in the general
business space and i tend to be slower
to make those moves um and i i think i
tend to sit in the opportunity vehicle
that i'm in a little longer than most
people and i think it served me well so
i'll give you an example to drive this
point home because i think it's
important
so i had one gym
and then i had two gyms and then i had
three gyms and then i had four gyms then
i had five gyms the night six gyms and i
opened them all at full capacity on day
one
and at the time the people who were
trying to coach gym owners either had
one gym or zero gyms and i never had
more than that and so finally when the
demand for the amount of people who
asked me to help them surpassed my my my
reasonable ability to do so with still
managing my gyms i sold my gyms to start
doing gym launch
then i took almost a year and a half

95
01:34:00.000 --> 01:35:00.000
flying around the country and doing gym
turnarounds so getting better at the
craft and i did that for almost a year
and a half
after that
i started we started the licensing model
which is you know what we did we still
continue to do it right
and after we did our first million a
month and then two million a month and
then four million a month people were
like hey
you should start general business
coaching we had our first four million
dollar a month i think
in january of 2019 for contacts
while ago
and still
i tend to sit with things a little
longer because i think the depth of
knowledge is important i think that the
devils and the details i think the
expertise shows up at the nuances
and so um
i actually remember the original
question
but uh i think you asked about the book
and so
the what's happened since i wrote the
book is like
i think that people felt like there was
a level of expertise that was
demonstrated in the book that was in
access or different than other people's

96
01:35:00.000 --> 01:36:00.000
stuff and so that is why it was being
shared
but every name that you have heard of
the marketing space reached out to me
because four people told them about the
book
so garrett why reach out to me frank
curran reached out to me dave woodward
from clickfunnels reached out to me
russell reached out to me um dan henry
reached out to me tanner chidester
reached out to me all those guys reached
out to me because 10 other people had
told them about the book and they were
like you know what man i wasn't really
going to read your book and i read it
and [ __ ] man i just emailed my whole
list about it thanks
and so
i think that a lot of us think it like
who here has ever been to a restaurant
and had a sandwich and been like man if
i had a restaurant my sandwiches would
not be shitty like this
anyone
i know that if i had a restaurant they'd
have [ __ ] good sandwiches it seems
like a simple thing
but most people who are struggling as
entrepreneurs serve [ __ ] food and the
only way they make money is that they
charge people before they eat

97
01:36:00.000 --> 01:37:00.000
and so i know that i know that everybody
who's probably one or two steps ahead of
you
is telling you you just need to sell
more
but i'm telling you it's a very tiring
existence to have to sell more
and this is just the perspective that
time has given me
is that the only endeavors that i pursue
now with a little bit more perspective
are things that i know that when i sell
them to somebody they stay forever
and that is where i want to focus my
time on i want to focus on one-time
inputs that have compounding returns i
want to spend more time on the book so
that when it is good enough it will
continue to generate sales and i don't
need to run marketing campaigns i don't
need to have people who are constantly
pushing it it just runs on its own on
its own merit and i think more
businesses would be better served doing
that and i think it takes time to get
there
wow guys let's uh give alex one last
round of applause
thank you so much alex appreciate you so
much man have an amazing day
and uh is there anything else we could
do to support you
ah just leave a review if you think the
book is good it actually does help the

98
01:37:00.000 --> 01:38:00.000
book a lot um so that would be
meaningful and if you guys like this
type of stuff i make a bunch of youtube
videos um and i have nothing to take
time so you know you can follow me on
tick tock
i want to see you some dancing videos
alex it's just a matter of i think
they're just ripping it from youtube to
be honest with you but we'll
we'll see man i mean you would stand out
so
all right we'll talk soon peace out

v
