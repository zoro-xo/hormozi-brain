00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:00.000
hey i just got sale secrets from the
number one most hated man on the
internet you're gonna love what he
shares
about how to make more high ticket sales
all right so
listen put your judgment aside and watch
this podcast with alex hormozy from gym
lunch
alex welcome to the early to ride
podcast i'm going to grill you on sales
and marketing and leadership on this
what do you think of that
i'm terrified all right i hope i can
measure up strike fear into uh guess
from the opening question that's what i
was told was good podcasting
all right so so listen uh quick story
you went from
nothing to something tell us about it uh
tell us about how you did that
in 20 seconds
yeah cool life story in 20 seconds yeah
dropped everything talked to somebody to
see if i could model what they were
doing
they said sure uh three months after
spending every waking hour with somebody
who's making a lot more than me i
started my own business which was a gym

2
00:01:00.000 --> 00:02:00.000
scaled that gym from zero to six
locations in uh three years off cash
flow using the skills that i
had learned over time talked to another
mentor that mentor told me to
teach other people how i was doing it
rather than scaling to 100 locations
so i listened to that mentor because he
made more than my other mentor did and
he made more than me so i said okay
and so i started doing that i started
flying out to gyms and doing turnarounds
for two years
then from there i packaged those uh
those services or that
that process into a box and taught
people how i was doing the gym
turnarounds
and that's when uh that was march 17 and
then um
from there we've done a 110 million in
sales uh
over four and a half or whatever
whatever how many years it's been since
then
so i guess it's almost five almost five
no march of 17
so four four years uh whatever the math
is yeah
would you want to be his kid when you
were like when i grow up i want to be
with you
i was a doctor so i said i was going to
be a doctor it was a pretty
i don't think i gave it a ton of thought

3
00:02:00.000 --> 00:03:00.000
when did you
want to become an entrepreneur once you
saw when entrepreneurs had
more freedom or more money or just when
you start working for one
uh no i uh so it's funny because i
wasn't an entrepreneurial person at all
um like everyone's like i was slinging
lemonade like i never did yeah i was
never swinging lemonade either
yeah i never i didn't went to college
like you know i mean like i studied
i always got good grades like i would be
like man school failed me like i didn't
have any of that stuff
um i got a mansion consulting job for
two years hated it
um but before that i was pre-med and um
i was like
i just don't enjoy this like this is
like if this is
and then i thought about what being a
doctor was and it was i was gonna
probably take over my dad's practice
and i mean my dad well i won't show what
he makes but
he makes good money you know he's a
plastic surgeon so he makes good money
and i would be able to start making that
at like
30 you know what i mean which is like my
age now right
and uh take it over for him and that
would have been that would have been it
and most people when i tell them like i
turned down a

4
00:03:00.000 --> 00:04:00.000
very good living to just try something
on my own they're like
i don't know why you do that i totally
would have taken that gig
um but i didn't want anyone to ever say
that i was
i didn't make my own success because i
knew that i would i would feel
it would feel empty that was that's an
ego thing
um the second one was uh
i uh the idea of living the exact same
place for the rest of my life doing the
same surgery over and over again sounded
like
murder um and i wanted to be able to
make money without
trading time and so that was my big
conclusion was i wanted to make lots and
lots of money
and i didn't want to have to work and i
knew no job was going to get that for me
and so the only
chance that i had was to go out on my
own so i was like i have a
unrealistic goal and i can either change
my goal or i can give it a shot i know
i'll regret it if i don't take a shot
and so that was ultimately made me take
the jump
but for me it was terrifying i'm
actually pretty risk averse when it
comes to
money stuff cool well i mean there's
going to be lots to unpack in this one i

5
00:04:00.000 --> 00:05:00.000
think that one of the things i
i'd like to start on first you were kind
enough to share with me a couple
podcasts that you did
for your own show about the the the
mistakes the
failures that you had in 2019 the
failures that you had in 2020
and i i was going through them and i
just had so many
questions and i want to start with
the you know going through the hormozy
lessons is
starting a business and creating an
offer most people screw it up
from moment number one and they they
work
so hard for like a year and go i don't
know why i can't
get past 100k in revenue or first client
or
you know we've been stuck at 300k for 10
years now
it often comes down to to their offers
and it's not like every offer you've had
has worked because you said you've had
offers that failed like
your supplement secrets package so why
don't you tell us like
i finally figured out how to sell that
by the way what's that i finally figured

6
00:05:00.000 --> 00:06:00.000
out how to sell
oh good good well watch us walk us
through like an offer that worked for
you which allowed you to scale so fast
then why that one failed and then how
you fixed it
and then what the heck does that mean
for somebody who has a business
whose offer doesn't work so okay
there's definitely lots of impact with
that so i'm gonna i'm gonna start with
my second one first
no it's fine which was uh the supplement
one because it's fresh
uh so about two years ago when i was
making that one i started something
secrets which is uh basically a training
program that we have that
you know i think is like the average gym
does fourteen thousand dollars in their
first
in their first like 30 days working with
us right using that coach that's
selling supplements yeah selling
supplements you just both then how we do
our upsells just like with normal
members and new members like we have a
whole process and it's really simple
it's really easy to do it takes no
aspect
so i'm thinking this thing's going to be
a grand slam the average person is
making fourteen thousand dollars like
my god you know what i mean like we

7
00:06:00.000 --> 00:07:00.000
could sell the course for five grand and
then that's just in the first 30 days
and then
if they just run that process you know
three four times a year they make 60 to
80 grand
off of a one you know one time five
thousand dollar investment like
doesn't get better than that they don't
have to buy inventory all that stuff
um and i have five person sales team and
we could not i mean we could sell it but
it's just
you know i mean like you i know one of
the hardest things about
entrepreneurship is
what is and i think this comes with
maturity like being in the game long
enough it's like
i know how hard something should feel in
the beginning everything feels hard so
you just don't know when to like
stop but like as you get more like
nuanced you're like
this something's wrong here you know i
mean like i could grit through this but
something's off
and so we ended up not selling it and
just continually bolting it into our
primary offer which is for gyms but
um this year what we did was we actually
just sell
product and then give the information
for free
as a result as long as they buy this
much product
and people are far more willing to buy
products than they are information

8
00:07:00.000 --> 00:08:00.000
services on the phone with a low
in a low trust environment and so like
it's it was i was six inches you know
what i mean away so
if the same exact stuff was delivered it
was just which one was the core offer
and which one was the bonus
that's all that basically got switched i
had this information that was the core
offer and then
getting you know supplements was for
free was a bonus instead i was like no
you need to buy the supplements and the
information's free is a bonus
it sounds so silly but like people buy
on amazon without a salesman
all day long they go and they click
because people like tangible good
general population
likes tangible goods right entrepreneurs
will buy information
by time and you know they're more
complex buyers but
anyways that was a huge finding for me
and it was simply tweaking that offer um
and then obviously we give them you know
50
off that day and you know a couple other
incentives to
to get them to take action but that was
huge for us
and who came up with that solution was
that you was that your team
that was actually my director of growth

9
00:08:00.000 --> 00:09:00.000
okay
so just by you guys thinking about oh my
goodness how can we do this how can we
do this
it wasn't you i think this is just like
a lesson for the entrepreneur like we
we have a lot of good ideas we don't
have all the good ideas
and was just was it in a meeting was it
in a brainstorming session or just one
day he was in the shower and
aha so i think it was more like he was
getting you know he was like
we tried to sell the info that didn't
work so it's like well
why don't we just give it to them for
free because if they sell product
they'll end up making money you know
what i mean just
like indirectly let's front the labor
for free and get
people to um it was iterative basically
is the answer
uh and and some people were successful
but
he noticed that the people who ended up
buying products
were successful and so then he was like
well shoot i'll just sell them the
products
and then coach them and then that and
that and that
you know quickly evolved and so that's
what the offer is because we looked at
the easiest way to do this retroactively
is okay let's look at 100 100 prospects
we brought in

10
00:09:00.000 --> 00:10:00.000
the you know here's the 15 that were
really successful what did these 15 do
that the other ones didn't
great let's try and force everyone to do
what these 15 did as part of our core
offer and so that's kind of how
we stumbled into that but that was a
huge breakthrough for us from an offer
structure standpoint
cool in that lessons podcast one of the
things you said was
all products must solve pain if they're
going to
be a massive success yeah how has that
applied to your offers
and when you work with gyms that were
struggling
did was that the reason that they were
struck was that one of the reasons they
were struggling
the reason that most gyms struggle is
because they're not that good
they're delivering results or anything
in the experience that they have
got it like if we're being real if you
go to a restaurant the food's
mind-blowing
you go back and you'd also tell your
friends that's
that's like good business the problem is
every business owner that you talk to
especially small business owners says
we're our delivery is great we just
can't get people in the door

11
00:10:00.000 --> 00:11:00.000
they all say the same thing right and
the reality is that if your delivery
were actually that great
you wouldn't have you wouldn't have
enough space for people right and the
thing is is that what you think is
exceptional is actually just average
yeah well i'll tell you what i'm going
to a gym here in miami i don't know if
you've ever been to anatomy here they
have four locations
they they they their shirts on every
trainer it says culture is everything
you go in there and
they're they're the nicest people they
they go out of their way
you know if if you've lost your towel
they tell
and they you know they have another
towel in your hand before you're like
what the heck just happened there
right and it really is fantastic and it
and it's so good
that what have i done i've told
everybody about it i'm telling everybody
about it
so so yeah there there you go it's
exactly
exactly the thing but back to the all
products muscle pain if they're going to
be a massive success
what that does i mean so that's the
reality right but the person that i'm

12
00:11:00.000 --> 00:12:00.000
selling to doesn't have the perspective
from which to make a judgment
they aren't they don't have that level
of awareness they don't have that level
of knowledge they don't they have
beliefs that limit them for whatever
reason from seeing that reality
um and so i have to meet them where they
are and so um
we tell a story that i call the garlic
and the ham it'll take 60 seconds but
you'll probably remember it
uh for the audience which is um there's
a little boy
i think it's a dog all right it's very
meaningful to him
his first real responsibility
responsibilities dad goes to work and
you know he's hanging out playing with
the dog and he realizes the dog has
ticks
he's like oh my god the dog has ticks my
dad's gonna think i'm a bad you know
taking care of person with a caregiver
and he's who goes to his grandmother who
he's at home with and he's like well
he's like
what do i do with the like how do i get
rid of the ticks and she says mikhail
she was like
she's like give the give the dog some
garlic
and then he'll eat it and he'll sweat
out some garlic and then the ticks will
go away he's like okay so he takes the
garlic goes to the dog
trying to puts in the dog's face and the
dog's like you know sniffing he's like
ah he doesn't want to eat it right
so he goes back to his grandmother and
says hey the

13
00:12:00.000 --> 00:13:00.000
the garlic didn't work he doesn't want
to eat it and she says oh
she's like you have to wrap it in the
ham you have to wrap that garlic in the
ham now go back to the
so it wraps it in the ham goes back to
the dog dog eats it
you know a couple minutes later that the
ticks crawl up the wall he realizes that
the dog the dog's fine the kid is saved
and everything everything's happy
and so the moral of the story is that
you have to give people what they want
not what they need
and so you have to give them the ham not
the garlic right
now they're going to eat the garlic
because they're going to start working
with you and once you gain trust you can
say hey by the way i think your product
sucks and i think your attention is
terrible and that's probably the reason
that your gym is
struggling right but i'm not going to
say it on the first call because it's
like
telling a lady that her metabolism
actually isn't slow it's because she
snacks in between meals and doesn't even
consciously know what she's eating
right and so i can't say that because
she's going to disagree with him which
is not relevant and then
now she doesn't like me right but
instead i say you know what
let's meet you where you're at you need
more leads let's get you more leads
because you've got an amazing product
and people just need to know about it
right and so that's the pain that they

14
00:13:00.000 --> 00:14:00.000
believe
they're experiencing exactly so you know
dan kennedy what would he say he would
say
sell them what they want give them what
they need sort of thing is that kind of
applying in this one
totally it's 100 yeah exactly so when
you when you do have an offer that fails
or when you have had
any setbacks in your business
and we all have many of them how do you
how do you bounce back
um i try and figure out what i try and
learn i i mean just because
i think we all become students of the
game and so it's like what was what was
missing on this
right so you look you simply look at it
a failure is not really a failure just
like a lesson
yeah exactly well i'm just curious i'm
wildly curious i'm like why
because like we have all this knowledge
we're really good at making offers and
marketing so we should
but like everyone who knows this like
there's so many nuances there's cultural
nuances there's sub market new watches
there's
there's all these tiny little aspects

15
00:14:00.000 --> 00:15:00.000
that can can tweak the effectiveness of
an offer
so when you you also said everyone hates
change and that i think you're referring
to
another offer that you had made or some
other some other aspect of
a failure why why is it that we hate
change why is it that we want to keep on
using the same version of hotmail that
came out in
1999 or the same way we just hate it
when facebook updates
why do people hate change and then if
you're selling somebody change how do
you get them to buy
into that wow that's a deep question
um so i'd say there's two halves to that
so you know why do
why do we hate change i think that
people will crave predictability and
control
and so they want to like that's why
people don't like crazy people because
they're not predictable
right you like certain people because
you know exactly you know you know how
the night's gonna go it's probably gonna
be okay or whatever it is right
um and we try and exert control over our
surroundings so that we can

16
00:15:00.000 --> 00:16:00.000
again try and predict right because we
don't like
we don't like change right we're
rational um in terms of
the second half of the question was um
uh how do we get someone to to to be
willing yeah
how do we get them to buy in i think
it's much more about investment so
there's
the the qualification process and the
investment
from the prospect um by the way these
are great questions i don't think i've
ever been answering these questions on a
podcast that's wonderful
um but yeah so it's the the the
qualification of the prospect will
increase the quality of the product and
the result so if i sell to smarter
better people i'll get better results
from my products simply because i'm
disqualifying the the numbnuts right
yeah
and so qualifications and then if i can
get someone to spend you know twenty
thousand dollars versus a dollar i'll
probably get a far more invested person
and so i see it as the obligation of the
coach or the company to get the person
invested
um so that like i believe sales is the
first step of actually creating an

17
00:16:00.000 --> 00:17:00.000
intervention like you have to sell them
on the on the change before they'll even
do it yeah
so recently you were talking about sales
with our mutual friend jason capital and
his podcast and
and i wrote these down i shared them
with my email list because i thought
they were so powerful and
it was three things a prospect needs to
believe in order to buy
and the first one was that a product
solves their problem
in the way they want it to be solved so
essentially we've
we've pretty much covered that one in
that if somebody comes to you
and their business is not growing and
you
you're like oh you will you just have to
improve the experience and the retention
and
it'll be better but but they think it's
leads you'll never succeed if you try to
sell them anything other than that
if i want to have a girl who's trying to
lose weight and she wants to buy
supplements to lose weight and i try and
sell her gym membership
they both will in her mind help her lose
weight but the one that she wants to do
is a supplement so i should sell her
supplements yeah i'm just figuring that

18
00:17:00.000 --> 00:18:00.000
out and it's hard we need to learn this
the hard way
a fun anecdote for this in the gyms
people will come in will say hey do you
want to buy our stuff they'll say no
we say how about this just as a benefit
for coming in
why don't you come in for a free
nutrition consult because we still just
want to help you out
they come in for nutrition consult
average tickets 350 to supplement sales
to people who said no wow
and it's higher than people who said yes
why well one they didn't spend any money
on the first transaction
two right it's probably i don't see a
lazier person but somebody who wants a
more magic pill
yeah but that's that's leaked revenue
that so many businesses
are not doing is saying like well well
is it like not being awkward on the
sales call it's like can we just help
you anyways like you're here you still
want to solve the problem right maybe
the first thing maybe it's too big of a
commitment right now or if that doesn't
work with schedule that's fine
like can we just do this for free and
then you can solve the problem another
way create more revenue from
sawdust yeah i love that the second

19
00:18:00.000 --> 00:19:00.000
thing that a prospect needs according to
you is that they need to trust the
company
yeah i don't think a lot of people think
about that but what is that what does
that
mean and what does that look like
so i think it's like that's the brand
authority that's the stuff that gets
developed over time
um and of course that's not the the get
rich quick
you know answer but the reality is that
the reason that these brands that exist
sell for so much more money
and are literally more valuable is
because that brand equity exists
they have mind share so people are like
well i know i've heard of verizon
you know i mean they're not going
they're not they're not flash in a pan
they're not going tomorrow right yeah
whereas you
you know one two three you know cell
phone i don't know who you are calling
out of you know phoenix arizona
trying to sell me you know like phoenix
all the bad apples
right all the bad yeah phoenix and
florida man um
but but it's it's the trust piece i mean
you could even probably
go as far as to say that like all sales

20
00:19:00.000 --> 00:20:00.000
are simply a lack of trust
at the bottom like because if you had
absolute trust then someone would
would say you know what i thought i
needed supplements but if you think that
i really need this then i'll do it
right if you get absolute trust so i
think these are kind of like the step
below that
which is you know if you have less trust
in the situation then
these are the three that that have to be
solved yeah
okay and then well that mean the third
thing that you had in that list is they
need to trust the sales person
and you said if they need to think about
it that means they don't
trust you so you know if i'm joe bob and
i'm getting on a
sales call or i'm in person or i'm
knocking doors or whatever
how the heck do i develop trust as
quickly as possible and keep that trust
throughout the entire process
gosh and what's the worst what's the
worst thing that i could do to totally
blow the trust even if i have a great
offer of a great price point
and yet i screw it up how do people
screw that
the trust aspect up usually if they just

21
00:20:00.000 --> 00:21:00.000
talk and don't listen
i think not listening is probably the
number one way to destroy trust because
then they know that you don't care
got it because you're not listening to
what they're saying so why like so
if this is my first experience with you
then why do i expect anything after this
to be
better than what this should be my first
and best experience
they don't listen right but in terms of
trust
like trust is built subconsciously right
and so
the words that we say or the logic how
we say them
is the emotion right it's the emotional
influence and so there's
two aspects to how you say words there's
the tone and the emphasis
so i'll give you a a quick and fun
example
so i didn't say hit his wife
i didn't say he hit his wife i didn't
say he hit his wife i didn't say he hit
his wife
i didn't say he hit his wife i didn't
say he
hit his wife i didn't say he hit

22
00:21:00.000 --> 00:22:00.000
his wife i didn't say he hit his
wife one [ __ ] sentence
yeah nine meetings right and then if i
say
for example i'm on the phone and i say
hey i'm looking for craig
or like hey craig
you automatically are like i'm like hey
craig it's alex
pause emphasis goes up question it's
implied i didn't actually ask you a
question
right but you're like your brain knows
that you need to answer
like uh and you're thinking you're
racing because you're like who the [ __ ]
is alex
yeah right because like it's exactly i'm
like one
right i'm like from 123 fitness
and you're like but like because i asked
another question and it's like i'm
implying that you should know what i'm
talking about
so you're gonna pause and give me the
extra time because i asked two questions
only my tone right i remember when
jordan belfort
taught me that like i went to his jordan

23
00:22:00.000 --> 00:23:00.000
belfort seminar in like 2011
with joel marian i was like hey this is
and he has that nasal tone he goes yeah
this is jordan belfort
yeah is it i don't know you tell me
yeah you're the guy that called me and
claimed to be jordan belfort
but i'm telling you like i actually um
so i used to teach my sales teams before
i went through his thing and then when i
saw that i was like well you know
you do it enough times like it's this
you know i mean the truth is the truth
um but did you do did you do um when you
were younger did you do door-to-door
sales or or was it just gym floor sales
where you
kind of cut your chops yeah it was all
face-to-face
local leads that's all i did yeah in the
gym
yep in the gym face-to-face i think i
did 4 000 sales consults
when i looked at the crm so it's like i
had a lot of reps
i was fortunate because it was in the
very early days of facebook marketing so
we were just getting so many like i had
20 consults a day
and i just that's what i did i just sold
all day long

24
00:23:00.000 --> 00:24:00.000
and so um anywho the
the question the original but but here's
the thing is you ran 20
experiments a day if you look right that
way right and it's like okay
if you do yeah if you do 20 iterations
in a day
you're going to become pretty good
pretty quick and then you're going to be
able to start testing things out
and then you're gonna be able to do
those add-ons and next thing you know
like that's why you're grew so clear
yeah because when we actually started
teaching people we knew what we were
talking about and i think that
ultimately like the the depth that you
dig the well
is is how it's it's the foundation for
how tall the pyramid gets
right so a lot of people you know they
don't actually have any skills and they
learn one little trick and then they
make five thousand dollars a month you
know what i mean and they're like i
don't know why i can't get past five
thousand
point like you're just not that good
like you just don't like you actually
aren't that good at the skill that you
sell
like that's what it is right yeah um so
how do you develop trust
um you have rapid rapport you know
that's those

25
00:24:00.000 --> 00:25:00.000
there's so many subtle cues in terms of
how you introduce yourself how you
hi like it depends if you're in person
or you're or on the you know on the
phone if you're in person where you sit
in the room you want to sit not
across from them you want to sit
adjacent to them on the same side
right you want to be talking kind of
like friends because subconsciously they
see you as an ally
um you know before like there's you know
like before you even meet with them like
i used to do a cartwheel before i shake
anyone's hands that came in the gym
oh cool it's where to go and they were
like
like where they could see you or just
for your own internal state
they would they'd be they'd walk into
the gym they'd wait for me i'd give them
an ipad so they could flip through
testimonials and stuff with
a wall of five thousand testimonials and
then they'd be like i should be right
out to see you
and i would have a clipboard sitting
there um that i would
do my cartwheel and i'd come out and be
like hey
i bet you that was the weirdest intro
you've ever had to a gym come on in
we're a lot of fun here then i would
give them the tour
and i would literally walk in turn
around and i'd be like world's shortest
gym tour not so bad right
all right let's sit down and get to the
good stuff like why are you here

26
00:25:00.000 --> 00:26:00.000
right it's like just like that they're
like man this guy's fun
huh interesting this guy's in a good
mood if i come here
i will also be in a good mood because
ultimately i feel bad about myself
well i also well i was never able to do
a cartwheel so would i also then
somehow magically be able to do
cartwheels if i want to jump you could
probably do an ugly car going to be even
better
oh okay all right well i'm kind of down
with that
yeah so there you go
all right so so you did those you know
20 consults 4 000 a day 20 a day 4 000
over the time
is there anything else aside from those
three tips that you
shared there that you would really say
is important in high ticket sales so
you know the consults in the gym were
medium ticket maybe and then then you
moved up
like in i know in gym launch you sell
some really high ticket programs
was there any change between the two i

27
00:26:00.000 --> 00:27:00.000
mean sales wise now
okay it's just that we're selling you
know it's just most people value
you know making 200 000 a year a lot
more than they value
losing 20 pounds yeah that's what they
do
but sales wise it's not that different
and then how do you you know
when it comes to the classic objections
um you know like i gotta talk to my
spouse or
whoever i need to think about it uh
do you have a payment plan like you know
all that sort of stuff
any advice on like how do you guys do it
i mean i've heard i love
hearing about objection handling so
what's what's your team's
approach so
so if you're selling b to c versus b to
b if you're selling b to b which is high
ticket then the value component is
usually the easiest thing to describe
like like is it worth it right well
it's usually the it should be obvious
that it's worth it the problem is you
don't believe me
right that's i mean if i say i can make

28
00:27:00.000 --> 00:28:00.000
you 200 grand and it cost you 20.
is it worth it obviously so it's just
what do you need to see
to believe that this would be possible
for you
right sometimes just asking the question
um we'll get around a lot of obstacles
um and the thing is at some point like i
would this is me just even selling it
the way i normally would have been like
at what point after a thousand smallers
is it more unreasonable for you to not
believe than to believe
right like at what point does it become
less is it more i'm being the
unreasonable one versus you being the
unreasonable one
like what else would you need to say
because if you have no criteria for
making a decision then there's no way
anything will ever make you move forward
and you'll never be able to solve this
problem
right so the question is what would make
you move forward
and then if they're like i guess you're
right i think i'm just afraid and you're
like
then that makes you just like everyone
else who signs up and crushes it because
if you're afraid it means you're
it's not afraid you're just excited
you're just nervous because you haven't
done it before
and of course you haven't done it before
why would you that's why you're here
right and that's why you're paying us
because we have done it before we've
done it a thousand times we can help you

29
00:28:00.000 --> 00:29:00.000
through it
right notice the intonations in the
voice change
yeah right now if i was reading a script
and i was like
that's why we're going to be here with
you every step of the way to make sure
that you're going to be successful
hello robot alex it sounds weird yeah
right
but there's a lot of interpersonal
understanding that gets communicated
with how we speak
um so objection overcomes rather than
drilling like
price overcomes and spouse overcomes and
those things
fundamentally i think it's much better
to understand the theory because if you
understand the theory of why it works
then you can you can construct your own
kind of obstacle overcomes for any of
them
so from a price is a value question
right and so if you're spelling selling
b to c
it's even like that's where the value is
usually the harder part
b to b it's the trust starter part right
like people who are selling selling
weight loss they believe that if they
stop eating [ __ ] and move they're gonna
lose weight
they just don't know if it's worth it
right so you have to just you have to
agitate the pain and stop the value
so i for everyone who's listening if i
were to say hey here's the key to my

30
00:29:00.000 --> 00:30:00.000
bentley it's five grand
and i'll give it to you right now i
don't care how much money you have
you find a way to get five grand
because it's worth it and so that means
that every prospect you on the phone
with you get on the phone with
has a way to get you the money
if they think it's worth it and so if
you can approach the sales calls like
that
then you'll be able to close a lot more
deals and if you can encompass the
belief that rich people have money and
therefore they will give it to me and
poor people don't have money because
they give it away all the time which
means it should be easier for them to
give it to me so
whether someone's rich or poor either
way i win
and so the beliefs that you have to have
as a salesperson um but the people who
win at the end of the day is always the
one who's the most certain
and that's like something that people
say but i think is wildly underlooked
like i could if you give me someone
who's convicted i don't need to give him
a script i need to come a couple
milestones to hit and they're going to
sell
right because they believe here's a
great example of this so
you know i have three guys on my sales

31
00:30:00.000 --> 00:31:00.000
team they're good
you know they're all past clients they
they love the program
my fiance just started taking sales
calls
every single sales call she makes the
sale
because she's the biggest fan of the
four people
that take sales calls for my team you
know she's and she's so certain
because she believes in me and it's like
she doesn't even it's almost like she
doesn't even try on the sales calls
you know and and she but she wins every
time
so this so i have a training that i
cover how to sell expensive stuff right
and so
what we talked about earlier was like
the three things that they have to
believe right but in terms of
each sales like there's three big pieces
one is what questions to ask
the second is how to ask them right and
the third one is
how how how to duplicate that in other
people right so
the questions to ask right is what we
call the closer framework so clarify
cl it's a acronym so clarify why they're
there label them with a problem overview

32
00:31:00.000 --> 00:32:00.000
their past experiences which is a pain
cycle it's like what'd you do
how'd that work for you why didn't it
work
right you just keep until eventually
they're like that's everything i've
tried like man that must have been hard
for you
got it well you know what good news
bring you back up i think that you might
be really good fit for the program you
won't hear about it cool
then we can transition to s which is
sell a vacation because we're not
selling
the program the macros the the workouts
the
the the food that you're gonna have to
eat and how you got to wake up at 4 am
and how you're going to be sore we're
not
selling the programming right we're
selling the results on the bikini
we're not selling the plane flight we're
selling the vacation we're selling
maui not tsa baggage check you know
like wait in line guy farts next to you
like we're not selling all that stuff
but most people do they're like this is
week one we're gonna do this
week two we're gonna do this in our in
our marriage therapy program like
no one cares at the end of the 16 week
programs you're gonna be [ __ ] like
rabbits and you won't even remember my
name because you don't even show up for
the second half of the training which
happens half the time

33
00:32:00.000 --> 00:33:00.000
right right and so um
that's s and then explain away their
concerns because every logical person
has them
and then reinforce their decision right
after they do buy
this is something we added later on
probably two years into me teaching
sales stuff was
reinforce the decision because then you
because some people have cold feet and
it's okay so it's like hey
you did you made the right call you're
in the right place so those are those
are
the objectives that we're trying to
clarify right
when we're trying to say the words the
right way
i say you can either trick yourself you
can train yourself right if you train
yourself it's learning the different
towns
right and i need to lower my voice so
that you know that what i'm saying right
now is incredibly important
right when i raise my voice i get you
more excited again
right um you can train i thought i was
just going deaf there for a second
or uh you can you can uh trick yourself
and i think it's
and my personal belief is that we all
kind of just need to trick ourselves
which is you need to just believe in the
product
right you just need to believe in the

34
00:33:00.000 --> 00:34:00.000
product because conviction will always
fix your tone
your girlfriend is a perfect example of
this and the headline that i use for
that section is
how a brand new person who's a complete
believer can outsell a seasoned sales
pro
seven days a week and twice on sunday by
simply controlling the way they say
words
right and she says the words the right
way because she says them like somebody
who actually believes them
and so i had a i used to i did uh i used
to do some sales consulting
like intermittently briefly um
and i did this i did this consulting gig
with a mortgage broker
mortgage leads uh marketing agents so
they sold leads to mortgage brokers
and an eight or nine person sales team
they had me fly in
you know first half the day i reworked
their script and the offer and all that
kind of stuff and then the second half
of the day they were like
can you do like glenn garrigan ross and
just like you know amp up the team and i
was like
we'll see you know like i'll find out
and i was like who's the guy you're
having much trouble with there's this
guy
john and i was like all right so i walk
around the floor and
before i even hand out the the scripts i

35
00:34:00.000 --> 00:35:00.000
was like
john how good are the leads so you guys
saw
he was like well i mean
they're sorta and i was like i'm good
thank you um
he didn't like he couldn't even answer
the question say they're [ __ ] awesome
that's all he needed to say
because if he truly believed they'd be
like oh man these things are amazing i'm
studying for my real estate exam right
now because i want to start using these
so i can make some deals on the side of
them here
and hopefully i'll be able to make more
doing the real estate gig but for right
now
i'm getting all these realtors on my
aunt is a realtor so she's got on board
and we're trying to do some sort of ref
share commission because these leads are
so hot
it's like there's so many buyers in
these things right
i was like if you truly believed you say
it different
because most people i believe are
ethical and so
the way that you have to do this because
and the thing is is you have to be a
realistic person you can't lie you have
to fix your product which we talked
about the first half is called right
you have to fix your product but from a
sales team perspective and if you're
selling for yourself
the problem when you're an entrepreneur

36
00:35:00.000 --> 00:36:00.000
is you hear all the good and the bad and
the bad sticks with you a lot more
right and the fundamental thing is every
person who signs up for a gym
a lot of people don't lose weight a lot
of people want to lose weight a lot of
people don't show up and especially if
you have any kind of service where
somebody has to do something to see a
result
right you're always going to have that
and so what i've boiled it down to is
what is your intention
because there are people who sign people
you know there are people who have
absolutely amazing intentions um and
whether or not someone is good or bad
you know what i mean like as soon as you
have less than 100 success rate
there is a that means that you were you
were accepting that there is a risk that
somebody who's on the other side of the
line so whether it's 99
52 percent it's all subjective after
you're not at 100
which basically means all of us are and
so the way to get around that
right or at least increase your
conviction is a to understand it
logically
but b to remind yourself of the
victories of the clients you have served
right and so for us our team reads those
testimonials every morning of the last
week so all the people that signed up
last week

37
00:36:00.000 --> 00:37:00.000
people those same people like hey
remember john from last week
boom made 12 grand in his first week
with us remember sarah
boom and so when they say that they can
get on the calm and be like dude you got
to get on
like what are you waiting for wow that
that is not is one thing i'm not doing
with my team and that's just
that's just fantastic right it matters
more than everything
because if they believe they will i mean
fundamentally sales just
a transference of belief sure and you
know that i'm not saying anything you
don't know
but like so i have to fill their cup up
so they have something to transfer
they can have all the skills in the
world
love it that's so good that's so good
another thing that you said there
briefly was like you know people
lose faith in their decision after i
don't know it's like two weeks or
something
and in the interview with jason you said
that the time frame when most clients
will decide to stay or leave is between
the
sales call and first touch point with
your product or service
to improve this connection handwritten

38
00:37:00.000 --> 00:38:00.000
cards
clarity about their homework whatever it
is like what do you
what can we do in our businesses to make
people go
yeah man ordering that uh lamborghini
was the right idea instead of ordering
you know the porsche you know that cost
you know cost twice as much you know i i
must have made the right decision even
though i'm not getting it for three
months
and i could have got the portion a month
like how how do you fix that
so the nice thing about having the
software company that we own is that
there's so much
literature and onboarding and activation
in the software community
um that's so quantified that
like no one in like our world you know
what i mean like applies that stuff and
so
like we just started applying all the
metrics that we need from them
and candidly a lot of it's soft touch
stuff um
but like all the sales guys need to take
notes on the on the prospects when they
ask the questions what is your goal
write it down what like what are the
things you've tried in the past
write it down but it also makes you
better listen because you actually have
to take notes
but beyond that the person who's going

39
00:38:00.000 --> 00:39:00.000
to onboard them or welcome to them to
the community is going to be like hey
john
sounds like you've done this in this in
the past totally understand but you're
excited about this
and this is the biggest problem that you
said that's that you know you're having
in your business and so that's what
we're going to be focused on for the
next next period of time they get that
right
awesome they're like holy [ __ ] like in
your daughter's name sarah and
you're like in your dog's name skip and
they're like holy cow
right and so that so from the from the
time that the salesman closes the deal
they'll get you know that everything has
to be
so tightly choreographed from there
especially that first like two to four
weeks has to be
airtight like there should never be
blank space of like
there's never a call where they don't
know when the next call is happening
there should never be any time where
they're they're not getting an email and
a phone call and a text to remind them
of those things that are going to happen
next because people don't listen
right or they forget or whatever they're
right right and so every single one of
these communications is
duplicated in multiple ways distributed
across channels
and honestly i would say one of the
biggest things that we have

40
00:39:00.000 --> 00:40:00.000
that has been unreal for us is like
the person who does your onboarding is
like is what they are judging your
entire company on
and so many of us just like i know that
i did this in the beginning
just you know i just hired you know
frontline support to to just take over
you know yeah this is onboard where i
check the process off i cannot tell you
the difference in conversions on the
back end
by putting a true stud in there you know
paid two three times what you would
normally pay someone in that role
to absolutely wow customers
wow that's awesome like you you will it
will it will make you
so much more for just focusing
on that first touch but i mean think
about it like you buy something
expensive and the first thing that you
go like i mean if you think about from a
customer standpoint like
we're sometimes we forget like that we
are also customers of so many other
businesses
like if i hopped on a sales call and i
get on the first call and they're like
hey alex i look through your website it

41
00:40:00.000 --> 00:41:00.000
looks like you had these things you told
you know jerry earlier that this was
yours
he's got like literally they just bought
themselves two more months for me
of like forgiveness right because like
we're human businesses are gonna mess up
because we're made of of humans right
but if i can buy myself
wiggle room if i can buy myself good
will with just
writing down the information
regurgitating back to them showing that
we actually care and then making a
little bit more customized for them
just a little bit just like you said
this is your thing you're definitely
going to want to check out this piece
it's going to really help you out
wow thanks right and then they get the
handwritten card
after that call and they're like whoa
these guys are really legit
got it perfect perfect that's amazing
man oh so helpful
so helpful i feel like i should pay you
for this but i'm not going to
so so the um the
now when you one of the things you
mentioned we're going to switch gears
from sales a little bit

42
00:41:00.000 --> 00:42:00.000
you said you you know you owned a
software company you i know you owned
the gym launch it there was a couple
other things that you shared with me in
our
other call the other week that that you
do
and yet in the 2019
mistakes or 2020 mistakes you said yeah
i have too many businesses
and listen so do i so uh you know i was
on a sales
you know trying to sell three different
things today um why do we
tell people not to have so many
businesses
and yet we can't follow our own advice i
have finally had a breakthrough for this
so i'm very excited to share with you
okay so
um the decision to
start prestige labs when i started it
given the skill set and experience that
i had at the time was the wrong call
given the experience and discussion that
i had at the time it was the wrong call
i now have three companies and i have
directors who can drive growth
i have people who can actually grow the
business without me

43
00:42:00.000 --> 00:43:00.000
it's my understanding of how to
run a business has expanded dramatically
i would say that this is the first
season of my life
that i actually feel like a business
owner like genuinely where like i don't
really need to do like the business not
only will it continue to run
but it will continue to grow and
innovate without me
and that took a long time to get to and
honestly it also took a dip in revenue
for all of these new people to come in
for me to invest in them not take over
and
you know try and save the ship and all
that stuff getting the wrong people off
the bus
and i'll tell you i'll tell you a quick
story because i think it'll it'll drive
this point home
so the quick story is for everybody
who's listening
if you're if you're not you know if
you're not already doing
one to ten million dollars a year don't
think about starting another business
you're not going to try and pick three
and see which one works they will all
not work because you have three of them
so pick one commit to it and be done
with it until you're you know there

44
00:43:00.000 --> 00:44:00.000
the skill that we'll be lacking is your
ability to find talent
and the thing is is just like i said
earlier you have to have a perspective
from which to make a judgment on talent
and the problem is none of us have it
or most of us don't have it because we
don't know what it looks like
i didn't work in a big high level
corporate thing so i don't know what
true a players look like
i just know me right and so that's
that's the only like
comparative judgment i have and i know
other small business owners at the time
who also didn't have a player so there
was really nothing to
compare people against i had uh my
strategic meeting
um a week or two ago and a new hire that
we have here who's
actually not new he's two years old but
like she's been she's been working up
the ranks and now she got to come to the
strategic meeting so she's
she's new to that level and um
normally if she'd been given a directive
to find a new revenue stream for for
that specific business right which is
our supplement brand she said i get a
lot of people who ask me for apparel
we said okay well go see if you can find
some apparel companies that we can

45
00:44:00.000 --> 00:45:00.000
manufacture
so many people are asking for what most
employees would do in this situation is
they would google
apparel companies they would look at
five they'd pick the one with you know
they would present the two or three that
had the cheapest prices and say here are
the apparel companies which one you want
me to use
and if they're an appointed position
authority they'd probably just pick the
cheapest one
um and then order shirts from them be
like cool
we have an apparel line what this girl
did
was she went to 20 of them ordered
samples from all of them
got all the samples and word for word in
front of my entire executive team said
i'm not sending that out to my customers
she's like the quality was horrible she
was like i would never
specie indebted that she's like but i
did find another company they don't do
the shipping and the
and the in the manufacturing but we can
order from these ones
the material here is so much better and
they're cute and they're fun
and like i would totally wear this stuff
and i've already got
organized the company that can do the
printing so i just need to know what
budget you guys can give me and then

46
00:45:00.000 --> 00:46:00.000
i'll figure out
how many pieces that we can order
boom and that was the difference between
a player
and a b player and most people if you're
honest with yourself right now if you
ask somebody in your company to go do
something like that
they probably would have done with the
first person that's 90 percent of people
would have been like
all right i'm here my job they told me
to find an apparel company i picked five
this is the one of the best and here you
go you know what i mean like that's what
they would have done and
the thing is is you don't know any
better because it's hard to think of
something that isn't
happening right but
systematically now over the last however
18 months i finally feel like
we're almost there we're not there but
we're almost there where
we have people in positions that they're
actively growing
the business so this isn't me just
saying it being like oh you've probably
heard it my team's great
my team's highly flawed i have
definitely things people need to work on
all that stuff
but they have dem demonstrably
grown each of their product lines in

47
00:46:00.000 --> 00:47:00.000
ways that i'm not involved in it i don't
even know how they did it
they're they're doing new new
acquisition channels
the whole outbound team that we have on
gym launch i don't know how any of it
works
i didn't set up the data mining i didn't
set up the list i didn't create the
scripts
i didn't create the call team i didn't
create the recruitment process i've
created
none of it i told one high level leader
i think we should have an outbound
process
i need you to figure it out he said okay
and that's what happened and it's half
of our volume
so that's like being able to figure out
how to incentivize attract and find rain
makers entrepreneurs who really grow
actually is the hardest thing for every
business
and i think that now my businesses are
worth
significantly more because they actually
are businesses they generate cash flow
every month and i'm not required and
that has taken a long time to get to
and i it's hard to communicate if i
could go back in time and say hey 2018
yourself
i wouldn't even get it because i hired a

48
00:47:00.000 --> 00:48:00.000
director then
i hired somebody and it said director of
development
same thing it's just the wrong guy
and that's what's so hard is recognizing
this is a b
and you have to you have to let good
people go to have great people
say that again because i think that to
let good people go
to have great people yeah
that's a hard one it's a hard one
because most
yeah and most of us will say oh man i
really like that
i love rosie right
i love rosie but it's not fair to the
rest of the team it's not fair this
company
and you know rosie's good she'll go get
another job so like and there's maybe a
company that where
rosie goes she will be an a but just not
here
that's great uh before the call you said

49
00:48:00.000 --> 00:49:00.000
that there were some other maybe there
were
are there other breakthroughs that you
had in the leadership hiring stuff like
that that you were super excited to
share
that was the thing that i was excited to
share
do a cartwheel and then tell us yeah
that was what i'm excited to share i'm
just i'm super i can't i don't even
think i've said this
i'm super proud of the team that we have
now yeah and i don't think i've ever
said that well
it certainly should be with the way that
it sounds like uh you've got it going on
there
so long yeah and it's been painful
it's been so painful i mean anyone all
they need to do is look at my glass door
reviews
i've done i've done layoffs before
because i hired the wrong person they
literally i had an apartment that had 28
people in it because i hired the wrong
leader and they hired 28 people for
support there are three people who are
in that same support team now
with with better efficiency like
and like holy cow right how can how can

50
00:49:00.000 --> 00:50:00.000
this even happen and so i'll give you
one rule of thumb that i have for the
entrepreneurs in the room who have
layers of management
what i have what i have now because i've
gone i've gone too far away i've gone
too close
right because it's so it's because as
americans a lot of times we want to
solve problems
yeah but what it really is is we have to
manage dichotomies
we can't solve business right
you manage between micromanagement and
being too far removed
right it's a knife's edge you don't
solve it you just manage the dichotomy
right variety consistency right you
manage it
and um the the saying that i say to
myself
to to keep myself in check is know where
the bodies are buried
and so if i can think about a leader and
i don't know what's wrong
with their department i'm too far away
okay i have to know where the bodies are
buried
because if i hear that you know the
director's like oh everything is great
it's awesome
now is business there's always stuff

51
00:50:00.000 --> 00:51:00.000
that should be better and if you
literally think there's nothing that can
be improved
then like your tolerance is too low and
i'm gonna
i'm gonna fork into another thing
because it seems like you like this
topic
so my belief about
the quality of the individuals that sit
on the hierarchy of a business
is directly proportional to their
intolerance
so i believe that the person who should
be highest up in the company should have
the lowest tolerance
for anything but exceptional work and if
there's ever a time
where someone has a has a is more
intolerant
for the quality that jim lunch produces
than me than they should rightfully run
the company
and so if you see a department and you
see an employee and they have higher
standards
for what should be expected of customer
service which should be expected of the
sales team
like if someone's on that sales team and
the manager's like
you know and they're coming to you and
they're like dude why aren't we doing
daily trainings like why aren't we doing
drills every morning like why aren't we
listening to you know testimonials why

52
00:51:00.000 --> 00:52:00.000
are we doing a daily recap why am i not
getting a one-on-one i'm getting no
feedback on my
on my my sales calls right on my on how
i'm doing that person might be your
manager
yeah because they're like this is the
standard i'm expect i would be holding
it to here
sometimes it's like go get it you know
and so if there's ever someone and
that's how i see it is like who here
like like the the girl is talking about
who here is gonna say
i would never send this out to my
customers
complete ownership yeah
yeah that that gave me something to
think about too i appreciate that
um all right i got one last question for
you and and
one last question today because i have
about 30 left in my
list to ask you um this one
i don't think you've ever been asked it
and uh i'm kind of scared to ask it
a little bit not that scary so i will
ask it you're not the most liked man on

53
00:52:00.000 --> 00:53:00.000
the internet how do you deal with that
am i not the most likely no i don't
thank you
it's so sad it depends on who you listen
to i'm not the most liked man
either but neither of us are uh the rock
that's for sure
no we're not the rock it's cause rock
doesn't sell anything um
you know the rock actually sells a ton
well
he promotes oh yes i i see what
there is a difference you're right um
but yeah uh how do i do it honestly it's
not even a problem
like when you were younger did just like
it was always no problem
there's a lot of people a lot of people
are offended by the smallest thing
negative feedback to them right so oh
yeah
i mean i was just wondering if you
eventually
did a jedi mind trick to get over it
yeah
so uh two things one is the kind of the
journey and then kind of like the
where i'm currently out with it is um
you're only bothered by feedback that
you believe is true

54
00:53:00.000 --> 00:54:00.000
that's a good point if i said craig
you're a girl
you'd be like that's ridiculous i am not
so i i give no credence to your whatever
your comment
right what if i said craig's craig's
fulfillment [ __ ] his onboarding is
terrible the girl didn't even know my
name
on some love you might be like i don't
know i think i have no idea like
everyone is listening i have no idea
just making this up um
you on some level you might be like man
that new girl's probably she's not
she's not doing a good job you know what
i mean and so like and then if and then
you
shrink right you [ __ ] inwards because
you're like [ __ ]
and so um i think that the first step is
bulletproofing the product
number one accepting the fact that it's
not perfect
nothing right but i sleep well at night
knowing that
i've had 1 400 [ __ ] gyms who left me
a testimonial
you know what i mean i've got more
seven-figure gyms than most people even
have in their entire [ __ ] programs
right i've more seven figure gyms and

55
00:54:00.000 --> 00:55:00.000
most franchisors have clients
right and so i have to accept the fact
what i was saying earlier
about if you ever have any kind of thing
that has something to do where someone
else has to do half the work
if you're in the education space in any
way
i'll give you this quote which is there
are many shitty teachers
but only a terrible student doesn't
learn anything
right so if i go to class there's lots
of things to learn it might not be the
thing they're talking about but there's
lots of things to learn
you might have had terrible parents
growing up lots of things to learn
there's lots of ways to learn right and
so
the way that i do my heart check is just
what is my intention and what is my
commitment to making our
our product and our service excellent i
can tell you that three out of four
people who start with us for free
choose to pay they weren't sold they
choose to pay

56
00:55:00.000 --> 00:56:00.000
so am i am i the most hated man on the
internet
no am i strong in my beliefs
absolutely
but i like someone has to
in order if i if i do feel something
because of someone's question
i want to squash the root which is
there's some aspect of what they said
that i believe is true
if someone said alex is trying to scam
james he doesn't care about gym owners
i'm like it's a [ __ ] morning i do
care about gym owners it's literally all
i do
i've made so much money i don't need to
do this anymore
right and so i had a i'll give i'll wrap
this with one quick story
i had i had a media manager who's been
in the direct response base for a long
time
um this is a couple years ago and he
said
when i really got it like when i really
saw
why gym launch was so successful it
clicked because i was on one of your
sales team calls
and one of the sales guys was like hey
man you know this guy's got a thousand

57
00:56:00.000 --> 00:57:00.000
bucks
like that's just enough at the time
we're doing a thousand down was how we
did is
to start um he's like it's literally
gonna be
his last dollar you know what should i
do
and he was like and you didn't even
hesitate you were like we're his only
shot
like if he only has a thousand dollars
he's been open for two years like if he
doesn't do this he's [ __ ]
like he could potentially be [ __ ] if
he works with us but we are by far his
absolute best chance of being successful
because doing what he's doing clearly
isn't working right
and he was like when i he's like because
most people would be like no it's his
last
you know what i was like no we've got a
hundred ways to make someone money who's
got grit if he's got grit and he just
needs the tactics
then we can help him now if the guy
if the guy's on life support because
he's been smoking he won't put the
cigarettes down
there's nothing i can do about that but
if he didn't know cigarettes were bad
for him and he didn't know hamburgers
were terrible for him and he just needed
a new way because he's really dedicated
then i don't care if he's on life

58
00:57:00.000 --> 00:58:00.000
support we'll start feeding him right
now and he'll get up
yeah and i can say that with absolute
conviction
i know it because i've walked it you
know what i mean and
like i get i got asked a question
they're like you seem so certain that
you're
like how do you how do you develop that
i'm like because we [ __ ] did it
you know i mean like i went for two
years into gym turnarounds
not [ __ ] seven-figure agency you
don't i mean like small
you know whatever you know guru that you
see online that says go buy a course and
then become an agency and sell gym
owners
i did it for two years i worked guys
front desks
i saw the trainers i had six gyms of my
own that i sold
before doing 33 turnarounds
then i ran a mobile sales team while we
were doing the turnarounds
right and then we created more seven
figure gyms than anyone ever has you
sold more gyms that like you could take
the three biggest franchises that you
know of and put them together it's how
many jobs we had

59
00:58:00.000 --> 00:59:00.000
and so like you don't get there by not
knowing what you're doing you're not
believing what you're doing
and so like if someone's
you know if anyone has a negative thing
i would say
are they a competitor who has a who has
a stake who is a stake against me in
which case
i don't care what a competitor says if
he's talking about me he's promoting me
right which i appreciate thank you um
but beyond that it's like i i know we do
and i believe in it
so i don't i know i love it i love it
that was a really
really really great ending uh the only
ending that of a podcast that i've ever
done that is comparable to this one
is uh sabri's ending and did you get a
chance to connect with him
