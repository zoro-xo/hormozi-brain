00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:00.000
well hey there this is kim constable
welcome to the kim constable podcast
nobody cares
work harder i feel like sometimes
inserting a good swear word in there
like slapping the desk at the same time
but
anyway nobody cares work harder nice to
see you oh well i'm not really seeing
you i'm hearing you but nice to speak to
you all this week hi has your week been
has it been good well my week has been
absolutely
wonderful and it's made even better by
the very special guest that i have in my
podcast today
who is the absolutely incredible alex
hormozy yes alex is the other half
of leila hormozy who i interviewed on
the podcast a few weeks ago who you guys
absolutely loved and once i spoke to
layla and i heard her story
and i realized that she was just one
half
of a power couple i just knew that i had
to get the other half on the podcast and
so alex robertson let me tell you it
does not agree to very many podcast
interviews
so i feel massively privileged that he

2
00:01:00.000 --> 00:02:00.000
gave me
let me tell you a good 90 minutes of his
time
uh to be on this podcast so i felt
extremely privileged to be able to
answer him quite
ask him questions and i think he kind of
thought that this was going to be a
business podcast
well i don't actually know what he
thought but he probably thought i was
going to ask him loads of strategy
questions but
of course me being me i wanted to know
alex what was your childhood like and
what made you tick and why are you the
way you are and
we had so much fun on this podcast and
you i just know you're going to love
them this is like one of the smartest
man i've ever met
in my entire life let me tell you i met
a lot of smart men right
and whenever i was researching him and
watching some of his videos
i was just like holy [ __ ] what the hell
am i gonna ask this guy like what the
[ __ ] do you ask the smartest man in the
world
really like what kind of questions do
you actually ask him
so um and i kind of got a little nervous
as well it was like oh
he's me a bit nervous no i like what if
i make myself look stupid what if my
questions aren't intelligent enough
listen i do not get that way so it was

3
00:02:00.000 --> 00:03:00.000
really quite funny
but um it was really really really
fantastic talking to alex oh my god he
shared so much good stuff
so much strategy uh really you're gonna
find out in this episode what it
actually takes to be successful and it's
not
what you think right i i would say you
just need to pull up your big girl pants
and get on with it and work harder
well alex had a few other hints and tips
and tricks and strategies that he
uses to help you know people break
through their belief structure their
belief
that the patterns that they hold in
place that stops them from being
successful
loads of really good advice on that as
well as just speaking really candidly
about his experiences
and what has shaped him into who he is
today and let me tell you something else
for free
after the podcast ended right he stayed
on with me for another 30 minutes and
literally mapped out an entire business
strategy for me for the sculpted vegan
for next year
you see i was like totally blown away
and i'm a good soldier i do what i'm
told so i'm really gonna take away you

4
00:03:00.000 --> 00:04:00.000
know if someone
far more successful than me gives me
their advice and says here's what i
think you should do do you know what i
do
i do it i take the advice i don't go
well that sounds really good but i'm
going to do this thing over here no
no no that's why i'm successful because
i do what i'm told by someone who knows
what they're talking about
so alex if you're listening to this
thank you so much for your advice truly
i deeply appreciate the fact that you
even gave me 30 minutes of your time to
give me free business advice that i
probably would have had to have paid
i don't know 30 minutes of alex or
mosey's time to advise me on business
maybe a hundred thousand dollars
alex i owe you and i swear to god
whatever you need i'm here for you
so i'm gonna stop waffling all now
you're like okay kim shut the [ __ ] up

alex literally we haven't hardly even
had a conversation before this podcast
started which is the way i like it but
thank you so
much for agreeing to come on the podcast
thanks for having me i'm stoked to be
here i've been looking forward to it
since i
came on account you uh are probably i
would say
one of the only people on this earth
that i have found out is
busier than me or
more productive actually i would say
because there's being busy and then
there's being productive but i started
following you on instagram ever since i

6
00:05:00.000 --> 00:06:00.000
interviewed your fabulous wife a couple
of weeks ago
and started like stalking her and
stalking you on instagram
and i was like wow this guy actually i
think that's more done in a day than i
do and so just for that i wanted to
interview that
that makes me sound like i'm blowing
myself up and i don't really mean it to
be that way
but um you are pretty uh you are pretty
fabulous so i'm gonna read out a little
bit of a i'm gonna like embarrass you
here and read out a little bit of a
uh a bio about you is that okay so
everyone knows who you are
hopefully it's up to date it sounds
pretty impressive already ready let's go
you're gonna hear all about yourself now
alex vermosey is an american
entrepreneur investor and philanthropist
i love that word
he scaled four companies to are you
ready a hundred
million dollars in cumulative sales
across four different industries which
is software service e-commerce
and brick and mortar in under four years
here tell you what that's impressive
without taking on any outside capital
uh he is widely considered an
acquisition and monetization expert
he also makes mistakes which i love

7
00:06:00.000 --> 00:07:00.000
which we're going to talk about more
about and candidly shares his painful
lessons with aspiring entrepreneurs to
help them avoid his pitfalls
he donates much of his free time to
advancing equal access to education and
encouraging entrepreneurship in
underprivileged communities which i
absolutely and utterly love
but here alex here's how i want to start
this right
so i find out that you were in
management consultancy for two years
in space cyber intelligence is that
correct
it was yeah i bet not many people start
your interviews with with that little
nugget of information
no most people don't even know so uh
well here's here's why i was really
interested in that um particularly
because
um you you've said that well i've heard
you say um in some of the research i was
doing about you that you used that model
and applied that to gyms so you
applied what you had learned you know in
management consultancy
and and then applied that model whenever
you started your own gym can you talk us
through that a little bit what that was
like and then
how you took that model and and
transferred it into an industry which is
completely unrelated

8
00:07:00.000 --> 00:08:00.000
yes so uh the maintenance consulting
firm that i worked for was a boutique
strategy firm
and so we would be essentially hired in
to be the smartest people in the room
and that's the words of the partner not
me i was a 22 year old who knew nothing
at the time um and so
she had a specific process it was really
the company's process
of becoming smarter than the people who
were the experts and so with information
the hardest thing to do
is to find because there's so much of it
now in the beginning it was like you
just have to consume all the information
that you're done but now it's sifting
through the information
so you can find the good stuff that
becomes more valuable to skill which is
why consulting continues to grow as a
as a business model right and so the
process that we would go through
is that we would consult experts first
uh because experts have already sifted
through the vast majority of the data
and can point you to the data sources
they're going to be the highest quality
of the purest et cetera and so
what we would do was we would talk to we
would first get one introduction
to a high who who was widely considered

9
00:08:00.000 --> 00:09:00.000
the expert in the field
and we would interview this person try
and find as much as we could about the
field
and then after that and these people are
experts they love talking about the
thing that they're
experts in right and so we get tons of
information and then from there we'd say
hey can you give us five other people
you think
who's whose opinions you would value and
you think might add more color or depth
to this topic and they would give us
five people and then we'd go talk to
those five people do the same thing
and then after a certain period of time
you start getting the same names over
and over again
or the names become more obscure or more
off-topic and at that point you kind of
conclude the research
now that would be phase one um and this
would be like the
you know the peon's job which is what i
was doing at the time is i would i would
i would be the one transcribing and
writing down all this research
and so we'd have 400 pages 500 000 pages
worth of
transcriptions and then from there i
would the first step or the second step
would be to codify them so i would
highlight them based on topics so
i guess the pre-step before that is
knowing all the topics and then
highlighting the topics
and then i would reassemble them and
then i would condense them

10
00:09:00.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and eliminate because there's tons of
duplications a lot of people have the
same views on the same things
we'd recondense them and then from there
we would make a presentation based on
now
we have just talked to all of these
experts so we had our own inclinations
of what we thought would be the best
course of action
and then we'd present that to a two-star
three-star four-star general
in like 60 minutes and so that entire
project might take
six to 12 months or sometimes years to
do to answer a simple question which is
in a good friend of mine dr cashy says
the shorter the question the longer the
answer
um and so like what is life you know
it's like
and so they might say you know we want
to find the best way
to allocate our uh force mix
uh which would be like satellites
missiles human people you know people
etc against
assets so that we can have the least
amount of overlap
so we can ultimately kill the most
people right that would be the idea
and so then we would look at all of
these different ways of thinking through
it
the the different departments that would
be associated and then try to reorganize
it into something that was manageable

11
00:10:00.000 --> 00:11:00.000
for someone to take actions on and then
we would have
you know the second the upsell there
would be like and we can help you do the
implementation of this plan that we
would you know have just outlined for
you
and so something like that might cost
that 60 minute presentation we might
build three million dollars for
um as a consultancy and so that process
of consulting with experts and going
through these steps is
first when i was a gym owner i didn't
know anything about it and i think that
was an advantage because i didn't have
any preconceived notions and so
i emailed all these gyms and said hey
can i just hang out with you
and a lot of people said no but some
people said yes and i would drive two
hours i'd drive six hours
and i would spend a weekend and i would
just ask what do you do after this and
what do you do after this and a lot of
times there was a lot of useless stuff
but every once in a while i'd get these
nuggets i was like
that's great and you know week by week
month by month i started accumulating
these kind of
these tactics and these strategies that
would work well in the gym business
and i would implement them and then step
by step my gyms became more and more
profitable
from there um you know we started doing
flying out and so speed up three years
i went from you know one location to six

12
00:11:00.000 --> 00:12:00.000
uh i started
getting people asking me hey how can you
can you help me do what you did in your
gyms
at my gym and so then i started flying
out this is the moment i met layla and
this was the idea i pitched her and i
was like hey i think i'm gonna start
this business yeah my first date i was
like you need to quit your job and you
should join me
and she was like i haven't i just met
you on the internet and i was like
you're gonna do it eventually so just
come and so anyways i flew out i
launched three gyms with this model
and uh and and we i call them jim
launches because jim turnaround uh hurts
people's egos
so i would go into gym launches and but
i fixed their pricing we fixed their
packaging we fixed
basically the entire model how they
structured their sessions how they could
get more people in for square foot all
that kind of stuff
um and i came back and uh i don't know
if she told you the story but i had a
she picked me up from the airport and i
had a backpack and i had no clothes i
literally wore the same t-shirt shorts
every day for 90 days it was disgusting
uh
i was just sitting there inside out did
you oh yeah i did ever i did every trick
you could imagine
um i would just febreze and you know
put some alcohol on my face anyways um

13
00:12:00.000 --> 00:13:00.000
but i came back
and i said hey i know i promised you i
was gonna take you on a date which i
still hadn't taken our date yet we've
been talking for two or three months at
this point
i said you just got to do this one
favorite formula first what is it that's
like you got to process these payments
and so inside my my backpack i had a
stack of contracts this thick each one
of them was a 500
bill and so i said hey help me help me
process this and so i told her how to
process them
and we processed like 130 000 in like 45
minutes
and she was like what do you do again
you're like is it legal like it's
illegal
and that's when she quit her job and
then she decided to come out and do the
next launch with me
but that kind of consultative process of
first figure out the experts
apply the things see what works and then
continue that process again
once i had gym launch which is where i
did gym turnarounds i then started
consulting with businesses which was a
more
leverageable model and at that point i
was sharing everything that i knew at
that point but even then
i then had access to this massive
distribution network of information
and that became what i believe was going
to be our competitive advantage is that

14
00:13:00.000 --> 00:14:00.000
the bigger i grew my network the more
access to data i would have
and the more i could spin this wheel
where we would have the sharpest best
information if i have 2 000 gems to pull
from my top one percent
is the top 20 gyms that have less than 1
churn
and then i would interview all of them
as a panel take all the notes
compile them document with the actual
processes that will repeat against all
of them because everyone does a million
things but the question is what are the
five things that matter most
and so then we'd look at that and then i
would productize that information
and then i'd redistribute it through the
network and then we'd watch turn drop
across the network and that was the
problem we would we zeroed on one thing
hey who's doing who's the highest close
rate who's the highest show rates who's
got the best lead gen
process who's got the best referral
process who you know like each
little wheel of growth in the business
we would just apply that process to
and then productize it and then
distribute the training into the network
and that was what built the continuity
on the back end is that they knew that i
was always continuing to reinvest
in getting more information that i could
redistribute to them so that the gyms
that i had
and this is my goal at least with every
business that i work with is that they

15
00:14:00.000 --> 00:15:00.000
should do better than i did
not try and reduplicate because rye
ended his
my gyms never did what my top gyms do my
my top gyms uh capped at like 600 a year
the gyms that we have we have 63 gyms
that that did over a million
uh and you know some one i think they
did over two um just a single location
as a 2000 square foot tiny little you
know facility
and so anyways they they learned from
where i was that was that was baseline
and then from there how can we improve
the model so that was a long-winded
answer to your question but that is
the how i applied though i love it
because you've given me so now i'm like
i'm gonna ask this can i'm gonna ask
this and there's so many so many areas i
can go in with but i love what you said
i'm actually reading a book at the
minute by simon sinek
called uh no it's not simon sinek it's
matthew sid
um he has written some incredible books
and i think it's called the infinity
game
the infinity game i think it's called
and he talks exactly about that one of
them
one of the chapters is about borrowing
across industries
um and you know so many people just get
stuck in the industry in the way that it
was done and i think that i i did

16
00:15:00.000 --> 00:16:00.000
a similar thing to you with my industry
and that i um i started studying
internet marketing and i started
internet marketing for six years trying
to start and grow an internet business
and i learned everything there was to
learn about internet marketing before i
finally said screw this it's not gonna
work and i gave it up and i went back
i went and then i trained as a yoga
teacher and then when i started
bodybuilding
i realized hey hang on a second there's
no nobody in the pt
business or in the box i'm not even a
trained pt people say to me all the time
are you a personal trainer i go thank
god i'm not because i might have got
stuck in that mindset
but what i did was i took the um the
online marketing model and i applied it
to
a traditional gym based model or just
not your training model of what pts were
doing and
i'm the only one in the industry doing
what i'm doing and that's why my company
grew so fast because i borrowed across
industries which it seems as
what you did and that's why i got
excited whenever i heard about that
but one thing i would say alex is you
seem extremely
adept at taking um content and turning
that content into process and just the
way you were
explaining the management consultancy
rule taking an enormous amount of data

17
00:16:00.000 --> 00:17:00.000
consolidating that data and actually
then you know testing the data to
to figure out what is the higher level
process in it and it seems that that is
what you apply
to to your gyms and to your business
model but what i want to know is
were you always like that like you must
have been data driven or data focused in
order
you know you probably learned a lot of
the strategies in those two years of
management consultancy but what do you
think happened in your life to kind of
shape you
into having that kind of brain because
that doesn't just come from two years
post college
i believe that that is built somewhere
in childhood was there something that
happened or
or something you can identify that
turned you into a systems thinker which
is
what what it appears that you are um
so a couple things first the the
the two years of management's consulting
i didn't uh really learn any frameworks
about business at all i only learned how
to transcribe stuff and do the same
process
um and so i wouldn't attribute it to
that um
in terms of uh like brain and thinking

18
00:17:00.000 --> 00:18:00.000
i think you might find this interesting
but for until i was
in my 20 until i turned basically until
i started that job
um even maybe a year into that job i
actually thought i was very bad at math
and so i used to cheat all the way
through high school on every math test
and every math homework
i pretty much stopped my formal
education in in math at like eighth
grade so like algebra and like after
that i didn't do anything
um and so i'm bringing that up because i
think that
we're really trainable in the amount of
beliefs that we have like
our beliefs about our identity and
ourselves influence our skills more than
anything
and so at one point i decided i was not
going to be bad at math anymore
and my strategy for doing that was that
i was not going to use a calculator
anymore that was my
that was the action and then from that
point going forward i never used a
calculator and i made a lot of mistakes
but then i
started to get better and better and
better and now i can do lots of math in
my head
that people find cool and so i'm only
illustrating that story
in order to say um i think that i think
we all have these kind of unlocked
skills inside of us and sometimes having

19
00:18:00.000 --> 00:19:00.000
these beliefs around them
but in terms of a singular event that
happened that that caused me to think in
frameworks
um i don't know i think the way i i say
it is that like i just i'm not smart
enough to
remember things if i don't have a visual
or
some it has to be organized some way or
i i'll forget it
and so i think i'm really absent-minded
and so i have to make these
things so i can remember them um a
mentor once told me it's like you have
to make these artifacts
and so if you go through an experience
you have to make an artifact of it so it
crystallizes the knowledge and the
experience of something that you can
take with you
and so i kind of like that that thinking
about it
it sounds like a very inductive style of
learning i was similar growing up in
terms of i was i'm a very
um i'm very auditory digital i don't
ever done any nlp but
that was all i remember from nlp was
either visual auditory digital or
auditory tonal or kinesthetic
um i'm very auditory digital i'm the
kind of person i'll send you an email
which will say please see attached
if you give me like a graph or a pie

20
00:19:00.000 --> 00:20:00.000
chart i will shoot you
like if anyone in my company knows never
present data to me with color or graphs
or pie charts just give me the black and
white data that's how i interpret data
and so um but i i had a question
somewhere in here but i think that
um i whenever i was younger i detested
school detested skill like i hated being
told what to do i hated being controlled
i hated
being forced to sit in the classroom
learn i'm a very inductive learner i'm
going to give me the thing and let me
break it and take it apart and look at
it and figure [ __ ] out and then
and then i'll put it back together again
so that i can understand how
it works inductively in my body but did
you what kind of a childhood did you
have what you know
what were your if you don't mind me
asking i love to figure out what makes
people tick and why they
why they are the way they are like
that's what really kind of interests me
on this podcast so
what kind of an upbringing did you have
was it a traditional upbringing or was
there
some kind of juicy trauma you can share
with us yeah yeah
um i don't think that uh it's not so
you know what's unfortunate that my

21
00:20:00.000 --> 00:21:00.000
upbringing i think traditional is now
broken
if that makes sense i think most people
have traumatic childhoods and i think
that's mostly because we are children in
an adult world
and so we have the coping mechanisms
from children so for us to
to leave eight years unscathed uh is
unlikely
right and so um i don't think that my
trauma is any worse than anyone else's
because everything everyone met
everyone registers a 10 out of 10 pain
the same way
and so whether that means that your
father raped you your whole life um
versus i i knew a girl who had a very
wholesome upbringing and she told me the
most traumatic event was when her father
slammed his hand on the table and told
all the children to shut up
and i was like that is the worst thing
that happened in your childhood
and so but it was just as traumatic
arguably and anybody can can make their
counter argument but i think that we can
i think people can only register a
certain amount of pain
and so whatever that i think what
happens is your pain odometer gets
calibrated
but a 10 is still a 10. and so i don't
say this to to toot any horns
um with that you know context uh or

22
00:21:00.000 --> 00:22:00.000
preface my childhood was split my
parents split when i was five
uh they had a very ugly nine year
divorce
uh all arguing over who would have
custody over me
i had no siblings um my mother suffered
from
multiple mental health issues uh she's
you know she still has gone to the
uh i think she's she's battled demons
her whole life um
and because of that i think i was
i learned how to talk people off of
cliffs
and so i think that was and and being
able to read
someone's emotional state quickly um
was something that i think i i was able
to learn as a result of that
on the flip side my father is a is a
patriarchal middle eastern man
and so i have these very stark contrast
like hot cold water as the majority of
my childhood or at least my formative
years
and so i'd have a somewhat you know

23
00:22:00.000 --> 00:23:00.000
prolact better term
batshit crazy mother uh and that would
be juxtaposed against the father with
extraordinary amounts of uh discipline
and order and structure to everything
and so uh and what's interesting is i
actually think i take more after my
mother
uh in terms of how i think uh but i
think the
the the order that my my dad created was
positive that being said
what he was able to create was a hole
inside of me that i would never be able
to fill with enough
success fame ambition ever because it
would never be good enough
and now at this point
he's you know he continues to reiterate
that he is proud of me and all those
things
um he wasn't he wasn't a proponent of me
quitting my very fancy job
and going and starting a gym it's like
that um
really no one was but that being said uh
now he's he's on the train but after he
told me that he was proud which took
years um i realized when he said it that

24
00:23:00.000 --> 00:24:00.000
i didn't care
and that made sense to me because i left
without his consent which means that at
that point i'd actually made the
decision that i didn't care about what
he thought
and so although it is nice now that was
when the breaking point happened is when
i decided that his happiness was less
important than mine
and so you know the you know formative
experiences you know i'm sure
i'm sure the the the many things that
many of us have had in dramatic
childhoods
um i experienced um but i think that
ultimately those things were the things
that
gave me the um
going to go into tangent but i think
it'll be worth it so dr cashy who's my
closest friend
he and i talk all the time about these
types of things but negative
visualizations
and so if we can and this is one of i
think one of the strongest coping
mechanisms that exist
and my father was actually the one who
equipped me with it he said there's
nothing that anyone can do to you
that will be worse than what you've
already gone through
he's like just remember that and so that

25
00:24:00.000 --> 00:25:00.000
became a kind of armor
for me in terms of life is that no
matter what happened i was like
this is better than what i've been
through you know this is not this is not
a huge deal
and so it allowed me to minimize some of
the stressors in my life or my
perception of how stressful something
was
um as a result of that which is why i
don't know i think
everything can respond to positively i
mean good to have a wholesome childhood
i think
if you spin it the right way it can also
be great to have a horrible childhood
um just tell you how you see it yeah no
i think i think it's true the reason why
i usually ask about people's childhoods
especially successful people
is because i have found consistently
in successful people i have um i have
met in person or i've interviewed on the
podcast
that one of the very consistent things
amongst each and every one of them
is uh you can call it a traumatic
childhood but certainly
a non-traditional or you know a
childhood where
they suffered some kind of adversity so
children you know if they say if they

26
00:25:00.000 --> 00:26:00.000
don't suffer
adversity in their early years um it can
be obviously it can go both ways it can
actually
either make you very successful or it
can make you um
go the other way and be a victim or and
not make a success of your life
certainly from my own childhood and i
guess i'm interested because i do a lot
of
personal work myself and i know that a
lot of the experiences that i had with
very traumatic divorce same as you going
to boarding school at a very young age
having to just figure [ __ ] out and
realize that there ain't no one coming
to save you
it made me extremely resilient and i
guess one of the struggles that i have
is like i have four children
and you know i remember reading this
great quote once that said something
like every success was actually talking
about a father
every successful father struggles to
give this
his children the same struggles that he
had that made him successful because you
want your children to
you know you know what it is that made
you resilient successful in that
adversity and you want to give your
children as much adversity as possible
but also
you have a lot of money like we have a
private chef at home who cooks all our
children's food on a housekeeper who
brings them breakfast in bed and i'm

27
00:26:00.000 --> 00:27:00.000
like no don't do it you know
so um i guess that's why i'm interested
but um
what i want to know is how important it
sounds like you built a lot
of uh you built a lot of self-belief as
a child
which you talked about mindset being
really important and you built some
really good postulates really good
positive postulators just helped you to
be successful
how important is self-belief do you feel
in the people that you work with and you
train
in the gym owners that you work with or
even people you work with in general
you probably know what the answer is um
barry
i know but i kind of want you to break
it down from a people yeah yeah
um nothing can happen until
i mean fundamentally nothing in your
your reality
you know can happen this is my belief
right it can happen until it happens in
your head
right and and it's to some degree
there's i don't see that as like i'm
waking up every morning and just
visualizing my life and some people do
that and i'm not saying
there's anything wrong with that but at
the very least some people on a
subconscious level when they sign up for

28
00:27:00.000 --> 00:28:00.000
a program whether it's a weight loss
program or whether it's a
business coaching program or mentorship
they've already made the decision that
it's not going to work and they want to
prove to themselves that yet another
thing isn't going to work because they
are a special snowflake
right and so they don't want to lose
that feeling of being a special
snowflake that it's not their fault
just the world is stacked against them
and so
you know relinquishing that belief is
very hard for them and so
i think the most useful belief that i've
had has been that if someone can
therefore i can too and i think as soon
as you have one person and
i'm sure like elon musk for example is
like no one has done it and i will be
the first
and that's probably an even more useful
belief set but at the very least most
people who are listing this depending on
where they're at
i think simply jumping from well that
won't work for me
to if one person can therefore i can too
if i duplicate the actions
it's like roger bannister when he broke
the four minute mile up until that point
people believed that it wasn't possible
and then within
you know six months there were 16 year
old girls breaking the four minute mile

29
00:28:00.000 --> 00:29:00.000
you know it's once once the belief was
was built it was possible then that
everybody started doing it
um
so much good stuff i want to ask you um
goal setting
so i think it's a good segue into goal
setting i have heard you say that you
always
had a goal bigger than just being on the
gym floor whenever you first started
your gyms you had six gyms wasn't that
right
yeah and you never really just saw
yourself as being on the gym floor that
was never the bigger goal for you how
important
is goal setting in your life even
currently
dairy
i walked right into that didn't i ask me
an intelligent question tim please
between you know emotional goals and you
know like business goals right or like
something that's a tangible goal
so i want to get into shape or i want to
do this competition or i want to
make this amount of money whatever that
is those ones i think are
incredibly important and reversing first

30
00:29:00.000 --> 00:30:00.000
engineering what
it looks like on an hourly or daily
basis right and i i walk through this
exercise with
virtually every business that i consult
for um there's a couple of equations
that are on my
youtube channel that uh actually one got
posted today is called the pi equation
but it's basically the
probably the most used equation that i
use for all projections that i do in
business
um and understanding that equation how
you can project
inwards and outwards of where where you
can spot issues in the business
that is what i do that is my pulse right
in terms of long term i'm probably not
as good as it
at at it as like layla is layla's very
good at the
this is you know this is this is the
dream um
i've just always wanted more and it's
been less
concrete hers is like i want to live in
this place and have this type of life
and all that kind of stuff
i've been and it's probably been a
deficiency of mine is that i just want
to grow
almost at all costs um i just you know i
i seek that out because
and sometimes it's my own detriment

31
00:30:00.000 --> 00:31:00.000
because like for example there's four
businesses that we built to you know
multi-figures or whatever
but i probably would have been better
suited doing one to nine
right and it was because i i thought to
myself this is new and challenging i'm
gonna go try and figure this out so i
can grow
when i think that for the ultimate goal
the outcome of having a bigger business
that's more long-lasting et cetera
i should have stuck with that or maybe
even made a tiny pivot
rather than chasing the challenge um
chasing the optimal outcome which is
different you know what i mean there's a
process that's something that i'm
currently working on
alex i understand you on a level more
than you could ever know because
honestly
i just i feel exactly the same way like
i i was
next year we were we're actually
launching um an apparel company and a
supplement company the sculpted vegan is
growing like crazy and i was like gonna
launch my business company too
and i you know and last night i was
lying about 1am i was texting laila
actually she was like what the [ __ ] time
is it with you i was like it's what i am
i can't sleep
lying here planning my business next
year and i made the decision today i was

32
00:31:00.000 --> 00:32:00.000
like i'm not gonna do
my business i'm not gonna do the
business mentor program next year
i actually made the decision because i
was like my family sees
so little of me as it is you know and
i'm the mother right not that that means
anything really but you know the kids
and the emotional connection with the
mom is very important and
and i made that decision but i am like
i'm so like you it's that driven
compulsion isn't it it's like you know
people always say to me what do you want
i'm like i just want more i wanted a
million dollars and i wanted a multi
million dollars and i want a billion
dollars
and i it's just like it's just this
absolute and utter
i can't even put words to it this
feeling of needing to have more needing
to be the best needing to not even be
the best just needing
needing to do things to the
to the highest degree or to the furthest
you can possibly take it like i see you
get up at 4am every day
right i built my business between 5am
and 7am i had four kids i was
homeschooling it was the only time i had
free i got up at 4 30 every morning
coffee in hand at the table 4 45 and i
worked until 7am and they woke up
it was the only time i had so i [ __ ]

33
00:32:00.000 --> 00:33:00.000
did it when people say to me
oh you know i don't have the time i'm
like [ __ ] you you have the time get up
get up earlier you know stop making
excuses
do you feel the same way is it like a
like what is that what is the 4 4 a.m
for you can you break that down for us
uh so i think the four so
i do wake up really early um and i don't
want to take full credit for being you
know an absolute savage i think part of
it
is i wake up early um but that's also
because i go to bed early
um and i'm just a big believer that most
entrepreneurs need quiet time
you need focused energy time for
extended periods uh periods and
most of us are builders right most of us
like creating things
and creating things if you look at like
like compared to like like layla works
very differently than i do
uh she has lots more tasks she has a lot
more meetings and culture and leadership
and
a lot of coaching that she does
internally i have
almost none like almost no one reports
to me i'm just like
float around in my little bubble and as
a result of that though i think

34
00:33:00.000 --> 00:34:00.000
optimizing my day around being able to
stay in my creative space or my best
space as long as possible was kind of
what i did and so
if i wake up at four i can work by 4 30
and from 4 30 until 10 i've already got
five and a half six and a half i guess
what is that five and a half hours
of work in really before i have any any
conversation with another human
and three days a week i have nothing not
including weekends
so there's only two days a week that i
have anything on my calendar whatsoever
it's not that i don't work it's just
that i'm not talking to people and so
um some people because i know my first
billionaire friend that i met
he was like oh my god before i am that's
just so early and i was like well what
do you do he's like i'm a night owl
and so i think that i think you can you
can do it different ways like he he puts
his kids to bed
and then from nine to three is when he
gets the six hours in and then he sleeps
and he wakes up at nine or ten
so i think it's more important that we
have these quiet hours than the actual
time of day
but i think for me at least at the end
of the day i'm cooked
and so that's just how i function and so
i think for many people i don't see a
lot of people doing really good things

35
00:34:00.000 --> 00:35:00.000
after
six or seven they're just netflixing and
doing other stuff
and so for me i even when i was in
college um i
never i never worked past 9 pm ever
and i would just always rather just wake
up early and wake up fresh and then keep
studying rather than try and pull an
all-nighter
and so that's just how i work i don't
know if that's necessarily for everyone
but that's why i do it yeah no because i
remember you saying um
in a in a previous interview that i had
watched you said you know the first
discipline people need to learn is how
to control their own body
i love this guy because it's what i
teach constantly in the sculpted vegan
i'm like
literally you know show up do the work
have discipline build your inner word if
you can't trust your inner word
truly if you can't trust that when you
say you're going to do something you're
going to do it you have
nothing if you don't have your inner
word you have
nothing nothing you need to build
control self-control self-discipline you
need to show it when you say you're
going to show up and
get the work done do you teach that
inside your program is that something
that you
think that others can learn later in

36
00:35:00.000 --> 00:36:00.000
life or do you have like strategies for
okay hang on i'm gonna i'm gonna back
pedal i'm gonna say because i know i do
want to go into the business a little
bit and what it is that you do and what
it is that you teach because i want to
give you a bit of pr as well
but i guess what i find in my business
and especially this is part of the
reason why i've decided not to work with
entrepreneurs
next year specifically is because what i
see holds people back a lot is
is the emotional intelligence i can give
people strategies all [ __ ] day but
let me tell you something if you
don't have the emotional strength to do
what you know
you should do you're falling at the
first hurdle you're never going to get
past it and
do you find that in your business do you
find that it's a hurdle like people
lacking discipline and courage
and emotional knowledge stops them from
and if yes how do you help them get over
that
so yes i think i think the
the way to advance people is to break
their beliefs
and the belief breaking process the good
news about that for anyone who's
listening is that that is very well

37
00:36:00.000 --> 00:37:00.000
documented
and so the belief breaking process
typically revolves around stories
um that you can tell that rewrites or
overwrites someone's existing beliefs
out
and so if we can choreograph an
experience that is going to
get someone to be able to rewrite their
internal story then they will have a
core breakthrough
and then after that point their lens on
the world will change around this
specific topic
and so i'm a big believer that selling
properly
uh not only just on the initial sale but
continuously throughout
um is key to getting people to be
successful independent of what type of
coaching you do
right and so i think constantly every
single
implementation or intervention that you
know like for example if i was going to
uh so i actually did a sleep challenge
in our in our community
right and for anyone who's listening um
you know i heard
i heard a mentor one say if you can't
control the time you go to bed and wake
up every day how do you expect to
accomplish anything
great how do you expect to compost
anything great like you can't even
control the time you go to bed one time

38
00:37:00.000 --> 00:38:00.000
you wake up i had somebody message me
yesterday
and they said how do you wake up so
early i said i said an alarm
how do you get how do you get out of bed
how do you not how do you not snooze the
alarm i just don't
like i don't think i just really it's
not like and i don't even think about
that is it like
that hasn't even been a choice it like
it like i couldn't even really
comprehend the question because it's
just like i
it's time to get up and it's also
because i probably look forward to what
i'm doing i'm excited to start
working right but the sleep challenge
that i did
i had to frame it the first 45 minutes
of the presentation was
was breaking beliefs around why they
couldn't do it and why that belief is
false
before i said this is what we're going
to be doing it's your action steps
i think too often you know a lot of the
content that exists is just like
here's five steps to increase your
sleeping right but people are like
neat and then they just go about the day
but if i tell you before we start that
uh i start with do you know the
decisions that you make
are going to 100 dictate how your life
goes
is 100 based on the decisions underneath

39
00:38:00.000 --> 00:39:00.000
of that
how do you think you can directly impact
how how the quality of your decisions
let me tell you a story so when i was in
college
i had this really complex math problem
that i had to solve and i was staring at
this thing for two hours i was like i
tried everywhere i was like i cannot
figure this thing out
and then i went to bed and i woke up and
i looked at the problem and i solved it
in five minutes
and it was because i had fresh eyes and
i was well rested
and so so many of us could immediately
impact the
well-being in our lives our ability to
solve problems our ability to handle
stress
our ability to be good husbands our
testosterone levels
uh the amount of fat that we have all of
these things as a result of
one habit which instead of telling
people when i wake up i tell them to go
to bed
because waking up you'll be exhausted if
i can get you go to bed at the same time
you'll you will eventually wake up after
full night's sleep
just early you're like how do you you
must not sleep much i was like i go to
bed 8 30. i wake up at 4 30. it's eight
hours of sleep i mean i don't know why
that's you know i mean like it's

40
00:39:00.000 --> 00:40:00.000
fine and sometimes i wake up at 3 30
because i wake after seven hours like
it's okay
so anyways to to respond to your
question
yes i do think that is the biggest issue
the way to solve it i think is
telling stories that break beliefs and
then on top of that putting it in a
community where people starting cohorts
where someone starts the same time as
someone else and they can see someone
else
be successful and then immediately they
think well shoot this guy started the
same time as me because it's something
different to see someone in the past
who's been successful
but if someone starts at the same time
as you i'm sure you have entrepreneurs
who were in groups of yours or
you started in the journey at the same
time and if you saw one of them move
faster or bigger and you probably can
remember some time
you had this draw where all of a sudden
you had envy which i think is a healthy
emotion contrary to whatever things
you're this envy of i want what they
have
and i think if you can do that you can
pull people out of the whole
of inaction yes i i believe so i also i
think as well it comes down to being at
cause under understanding yourself well
enough i've heard you talk about that as

41
00:40:00.000 --> 00:41:00.000
well you see i did do my research on you
but actually it's very unlike me i have
to be honest but like i said whenever i
started watching you i was like [ __ ]
this guy's the smartest person i know so
i'm
about some really [ __ ] intelligent
questions and i think i'm feeling
miserably here but
so i don't really care you're like ask
me some strategy
or let me like tell you how brilliant i
am stop asking me
why i get up so early but um i'm always
interested i guess in in
what makes people tick you know and i've
heard you talk a lot about you know
culture and management and about
um about not being unethical and being
focused on creating value and these are
very
very these are not the values that
everybody has alex
you know if people do not understand uh
the emotional
they don't understand their own
emotional state first of all they don't
really understand how they
how they interact with the world and
their responsibility in it you know
and it takes a and when you truly are at
cause you understand your emotions you
understand how you affect other people
and the world and then you can take that
into a macro scale you can suddenly
broaden your view

42
00:41:00.000 --> 00:42:00.000
and you can start to work towards
something which is a little bit bigger
than than what you currently have
and i know that you do a lot of um
philanthropy work or that you actually
dedicate a lot of your free time to
you know equal access and education and
and underprivileged communities
what is the driver behind that like
where
what's the driver behind that for you
well i believe in entrepreneurship and i
think it's the only thing that
is you know a source of positive change
in the world i don't think the
government's going to save
us so because of that um
information is i think the only thing
that can set people free and learning
skills
and so the good thing is that the entire
school system is woefully inadequate
pretty much in every country um
especially when it comes to teaching
entrepreneurship
and that that personality type in
general and i don't think it's
necessarily i'm not nature versus
nurturing that i think some people like
there's so many different flavors of
entrepreneurs that i've met i'm sure
like you have
that really anyone can do it if they
choose to right
but i think the information that's out
there is really uh
not well organized and if i can if i can

43
00:42:00.000 --> 00:43:00.000
cut through that and give people a way
to find out how they can fish for
themselves that's something that's very
fulfilling for me
i had a teacher who stayed with me after
school when i was 15 years old
and he worked out with me two hours a
day
because of that um and i remember when
he when he when he called me out he saw
me in the hallways like hey boy
and i was like you know i went to all
guys school i was like
uh what he's like you lift weights and i
was like
no he's like you want to i was like
i don't know how. and he said come with
me after school i'll show you
and so um he he worked out of me you
know for two hours a day and he never
charged me anything and never asked for
anything
and in retrospect it was kind of almost
weird
but he did that for a year and he ended
up getting fired for
spending too much time with kids after
school weird um
but as a result of one guy basically
just really over investing in me

44
00:43:00.000 --> 00:44:00.000
for no actual reason besides his own
fulfillment or whatever
um that set me on a course of you know
personal development and
who would have maybe i would have
continued maybe would have found a
different teacher at a different time
it's very possible but as far as i'm
concerned this is what happened
and so if i can help facilitate that for
other people
then i will do that um i i do think
that a lot of us as much as you know i
think at different seasons in my life if
you ask me questions i'd have different
answers
um but i can i remember i used to get
really angry when i would see
billionaires say like
i'm just lucky because i was like that's
such horseshit of course you're not
lucky
but i feel like the further along i've
gotten i do feel like there's a lot more
luck to it
than i when i was kind of earlier on
because i was like you just got to get
punched in the face you got to keep
[ __ ] going you know do the boring
work and like that
we still we still espouse those values
because also people in my community are
at a different point
but when i look at the macro scale of
like some people are just not born with
a high iq
some people are born in in such

45
00:44:00.000 --> 00:45:00.000
traumatic experiences and
some people might have a genetic
predisposition
to not being able to handle stressors in
a certain way and that
childhood i had maybe with a different
gene set would have just been traumatic
and just crippled me
which is entirely possible and so when
you said earlier
i find that a lot of hyper successful
people had traumatic childhoods
i think a lot of people have traumatic
childhoods and a certain percentage of
people become successful
that's just my my belief if you look at
the bulgarians of to bring this as a
fitness example
uh the bulgarian weightlifting method uh
they basically took the entire country
and just put everyone in an
unbelievably high volume method that
pretty much breaks everyone but if you
do not break you become a champion
and i think that i think life is far
more similar to that
and then we say johnny how is it that
you can
that you can handle so much volume right
he's like well i mean i work out three
times a day and people are like man this
guy just unbelievable but it's like
i think a lot of people are just [ __ ]
for lack of a term
and so i think because of that um i
think to whom much is given much is

46
00:45:00.000 --> 00:46:00.000
expected
and so i feel like i've been given a lot
um in many ways with born in the united
states automatically i'm you know
300 million out of out of 8 billion or
whatever number it is now right i'm
already in the top whatever just for
being born in the united states
besides that i was born to i didn't have
financial hardships
growing up if i didn't have to worry
about food um
you know basic thing i didn't have to
worry about that um
now another x percent above that and so
like
if i look at the amount of things that
happen to me there are so many things
that were in my direction now sure i
absolutely did have to work hard i
absolutely did need to be able to
handle failure and getting punched in
the face and getting rejected
um and i did have to study and work at
skills and and work on my own confidence
my own beliefs in the inner inner world
like you said keeping my own promises to
myself
um but still i think that the the
overarching thing
is that that one statement is too much
is given as much as expected
and so if i can give back even a
percentage of what i've been given
through
the world the universe luck um i will

47
00:46:00.000 --> 00:47:00.000
do you think it's um you see i have
never really i was considered as being
luck and
a a lot i guess to do with opportunity
as well like i'm
a risk taker i see opportunities and i
see them and i act on instinct and i
take them and i move
fast when i see an opportunity and and
i'm willing to take that risk because
i'm willing
to fail you know i'm willing to like if
it all you know and i did
i did a training last week in my in my
business group and i said to them guys
here's the thing i said i see everything
is an experiment and everything is a bit
of fun because if it all went away
tomorrow
and i had to move with my husband and
kids into a council house wait i don't
know whether you have those over here
over in america whatever you would call
them like a state-owned
you know tiny little house and work in
mcdonald's
i would i would and i would claw my way
back up again so i'm not afraid to lose
what i have
because you know so then everything
everything just becomes an ex you know
just becomes an experiment and so
luck i guess you know i'm trying on what
you said i i think yes we are definitely
fortunate to you know i didn't struggle
financially even though i had a
traumatic childhood i went to a private

48
00:47:00.000 --> 00:48:00.000
boarding school for [ __ ] sake i had a
great education you know where it was my
mother there to kiss me whenever i fell
and hurt myself no
but like you know i had a i had a pretty
i had a pretty good childhood as well so
i think that there's a lot of
opportunity
but i think i think that a lot of people
are presented with opportunities but i
do believe that
seeing those opportunities and taking
them is a massive
um is a massive part of your success
like you you basically roped your wife
into going into business with you on the
first date
i mean tell us about that tell us about
tell us about layla and your
relationship because we have a lot of
female listeners here obviously and they
did hear layla last week and oh my god
the feedback i got was amazing so now
they're happy to hear the other side of
it
she's the best can i have one caveat to
the last thing before you close the
loop 100 so when it comes to luck and i
and i don't want to anger the the on the
on the way entrepreneurs that are like
of course you're not [ __ ] lucky you
worked really hard um i think
the the the wrinkle to that is that
it doesn't matter who you are you don't
know what cards you were dealt
and so the actions still remain the same

49
00:48:00.000 --> 00:49:00.000
and so whether or not it's like saying
you've got i'll give a better analogy to
make sense of it in a fitness analogy
because it's easy for me
um if you have really good genetics for
weightlifting
versus not having good genetics for
weightlifting
your genetics will matter but you also
have no idea what your genetics are
until you start lifting
and the only way to become a champion
either way is by lifting a lot and doing
it over and over again for a long period
of time
and so and the the additional corollary
to that is that
anybody who has talent compared to
someone who has
work ethic they've already proven this a
zillion times the
the outcome of somebody who works let's
say an hour a day on working on the
piano
skills versus somebody who's naturally
has an ear for music
if you compare those two people in a
year the person who worked is already
better
you compare those people in 10 years and
you only hear about how that 10-year
person
has so much natural talent and so i had
when i was growing up very bad beliefs
about my genetics

50
00:49:00.000 --> 00:50:00.000
with lifting i didn't think i had good
genetics i thought i had skinny guy
genetics i was like i can't
i can't get bigger and that's okay i was
like i accepted that
and then at one point just like the math
i was like what if i had freak genetics
what if i'm a mutant what if every time
i touch the weight
i grow and all of a sudden i started
believing that
and choosing to act as though that was
my genetic belief set and i added
another 30 pounds to my frame
and it happened over another five years
after i had plated i've already been
competing at that point
so it wasn't like i was a new trainee i
had or even training for almost a decade
at that point
and so a decade into my training i had
what most people considered a finished
body
right but then i still was able to add
another 30 pounds because that was a
belief
and so as much as i say now there is a
component of luck i think there is
but in no way is it useful for you to
think about it because it doesn't
concern you
because the cards were already dealt so
you just have to play them
yeah and you won't even i just wanted to
just
wrap that last piece in it's perfect and
you won't even know as you say what

51
00:50:00.000 --> 00:51:00.000
you're capable of unless you actually
do it unless you actually start working
towards it
you know you've only got a hypothesis in
the beginning but you have to test the
hypothesis of data
and then see does it actually i had a
girl who uh asked me about her
her job and she said i don't know if
this career is going to be useful for me
i want to make more money and i was like
have you considered selling
and she said um well i'm not good at
sales i said well
how many hours of sales training have
you gone through she's like well no i
was like
well then why would it be reasonable for
you to be good at sales you've never
even done it you've never even practiced
it
why would you be good she's like well i
haven't really thought about it like
that i was like of course you're [ __ ]
horrible
why would you right and so i think of a
lot of people like what i would give to
newer entrepreneurs
is do enough work that it would be
unreasonable for you to suck
it would be unreasonable if you do for
example like one of the big
for anybody who's in business i say do a
it's called a rule of 100 that's what i
call it so
you either do a hundred reach out today
or you spend a hundred dollars a day on
advertising
and you do that every day until you make
money and i guarantee you if you do that

52
00:51:00.000 --> 00:52:00.000
rule of 100
every day for a year you will not know
what to do with the amount of business
the problem is you now know what to do
why aren't you [ __ ] doing it
because of the emotional [ __ ] that kim
was talking about earlier so
anyway and then you got to figure that
out right but the the tactics are easy
it's the doing them that's hard
yeah but you see that's the most
frustrating thing for me whenever and i
love what you're saying and i guess that
that
you know we do see it in bodybuilding a
lot because you know we sold
30 000 programs this year and so on out
of the 30
000 programs that we sold we probably
had 10 percent
of people who actually followed through
and got the results you see
my 18-month program okay i have i
developed a program which was
which is an 18-month sculpt and tread
they build for 12 months and then they
sculpt their body for six months
and we sold i think in the first year we
sold maybe
1200 of those right 1200 programs and uh
someone said to me oh my god your 18
month program it's so amazing like
have you got some incredible
transformations i said no and they were
like
why not and i said because we have i
said do you want to know how many people
have finished the 18 months broken this

53
00:52:00.000 --> 00:53:00.000
was after like 24 months or something do
you know how many people have finished
it and they were like how many i was
like
two they were like two
i was like two people have actually
finished the program don't get me wrong
loads of people are 12 months in those
people got to nine months had to take a
break
loads of people got halfway through
three quarters away through a quarter of
the way through they're almost there
the um the only there were two people
who actually shredded to athlete styles
you know bodies and did photo shoots and
looked like a stage athlete at the end
of it now we have many many many more
now because we're three years down the
line
but it's like the same as the four week
shred we ran a competition we had
three thousand people joined the
four-week shred and we had two
hundred and two people or something
enter out of three thousand actually
entered the competition they actually
finished
it it's shocking people just don't
finish and you're right it's the
emotional component is the missing
component
and i guess this is um this is the bit
that i'm kind of
this is where i'm feeling frustrated at
the minute with the people with the
minded people that i have on my network
i'm sure you find it as well you know
you do you not
do you not get frustrated alex do you

54
00:53:00.000 --> 00:54:00.000
not get like you just want to shake them
and go
just do the [ __ ] work or are you much
more forgiving than me
and understanding um
i think it's taken some time to get to
get through that for me because there's
definitely
a long period of time where i would i
used up a lot of my emotional
energy trying to it's it's the
difference between being a savior and
being a guide
and i think that ultimately like you can
lead a horse to water but you can't make
a drink
i can really lead you to the like in the
matrix i can bring it to the door but
you have to walk through it
and so i think it's being able to think
like that i think has helped me honestly
gain a little bit of emotional distance
which
i think especially for you you know you
have so much reach and you have so many
people
that i think it's required in order to
maintain your honestly your mental
sanity mm-hmm
yeah it is it's true um oh my god i
can't believe we've been talking for
nearly an hour and i do really want to
know
because i love her so much i do want to
know about your life i want you to talk
about it i want to hear all your
projections
about her to be honest so i'm so

55
00:54:00.000 --> 00:55:00.000
interested to meet you just because she
is like one of my favorite people now
after such a short space of time
um and i was i was very curious to to
meet you
um to find out where you're just as
fabulous and you are but you like you
literally met her online
and then you were like let's go into
business together on your first date
and how long after until you got married
i think 11 months oh wow so quick yeah
yeah and then um but what the one of the
funnier parts of the story was uh
you know we got married but i asked her
to marry me
seven days or eight days or six it was
either six seven or eight days before we
got married
so we never really got engaged i just
said hey i think we should get married
that was my actual proposal i said you
know i've been thinking about it
i think it makes too much sense for us
not to be married that was my actual
proposal
and then i just said like do you agree
that was my proposal and she was like i
agree and i was like
okay well uh i guess you need to get a
ring then
and she was like yeah and so we got in
the car and went to the store bought a

56
00:55:00.000 --> 00:56:00.000
ring
came back 45 minutes later i was like
what else do we need to do
i guess we you know we should go get a
get a church so i called a local church
up and i was like hey you guys free on
wednesday night
i said okay sure i said can you just
stay after the
the sermon we'll see in the back i said
okay
uh and then we went and we got married
at the end we didn't have either of our
parents there
uh we didn't tell anyone we had one pair
of two friends who were there who were
local
and that was uh that was our we called
our parents later to tell them that we
were like hey we got engaged now like
that's amazing and we're like and we got
married
i love it do you not find that you many
women are just too [ __ ] emotional
they're just like i want the fairy tale
and the big wedding and i just find
women in general women in general
frustrate me which i think
listen to all the women listening to
this i love you all but you know i have
no bs attitude it's one thing people
always say about me i'm always going to
tell it like it is
and i i love women and i have there's
nothing wrong with wanting the the white
horse and the knight and the shining
armor and the sword and the big white
dress and the fairytale wedding
it's just not something that i wanted

57
00:56:00.000 --> 00:57:00.000
but i think that women in general are
too
[ __ ] hung up on the you know the
fairy tale which then comes crashing
down and the reality is very very
different
and um and i love the story i love that
story and
do you believe in soul mates do you
believe in like you know
meant to be like or no no you just
you were like you're my kind of girl
let's do it i think you need a line
mission and align values
and i think my god i agree if you
i think i mean this is right i i feel
very passionate about this
so i think most people do a horrible job
picking their mates
um and i think that if people looked at
them as
life partners um they would do much
better
and at least in my experience and this
is i'm i'm telling you right now 99 of
people are not doing this and i'm not
saying that made the wrong call i'm just
i'll give you my perspective
um i had many many relationships as did
layla
before we met each other that were very
explosive
romance emotion ups and downs and crazy

58
00:57:00.000 --> 00:58:00.000
chemistry and all that stuff we had all
that
and when layla and i met on our first
date that lasted four hours
we didn't have any romantic connection
whatsoever in fact on our second date
layla was like i don't really get any
sexual vibes from you and then i just
barely laughed
right because i'd never heard that from
a single in my entire life
and um but i'm saying
i'm telling this story to illustrate the
point which is like we were just like
she was interested in me and i found her
interesting
we had really similar views we had very
similar upbringing so i had a middle
eastern father
white crazy mother she had a middle
eastern father white crazy mother we
both left where we were
to go to california to pursue fitness at
the same age at the same time
we both swipe right you know and we both
we both followed a very similar path
and so as a result of that we both
wanted similar things out of life
and we wanted to get there which is the
values in a similar way and so i think
uh and all the research that we did um
you look at look at like arranged
marriages
right the success rate or the the

59
00:58:00.000 --> 00:59:00.000
divorce rate arranged marriage is
significantly lower
than voluntary marriages now you can
make arguments of like there's parental
pressures and other things like that
but it's a it's an overwhelming
percentage more and i've met multiple
people who
uh are in arranged marriages who are
from indian because my stepmother is
indian
and have phenomenal marriages and i
think it comes from
low expectations high commitment and
everyone in culture has the reverse
which is a hundred percent expectation
zero commitment and they also want the
other person to satisfy every human need
they have which is impossible
and so if we can approach this i think
it's just as a collective if everyone
approached their mate as
this is where i want to go this is how i
would like to get there
would you like to get go on this journey
with me and
we will we will learn to love each other
along the way i would say like right now
i love layla more than i did
and i feel like people say that but like
i we didn't like each other that much
and when we got married we were not in
love so that's why that proposal was
that way is because like
i didn't have like any horse and fairy

60
00:59:00.000 --> 01:00:00.000
thoughts because i was like this makes
sense
let's come to an agreement do you like
do you feel like this exchange is is
valuable for both of us
and do you think that this could that we
could both become more valuable assets
together
and she agreed and so that was kind of
the foundation of our relationship but
by doing that our relationship has been
founded a lot on rational thinking
and so you know because of that we have
very low volatility in our relationship
we've been in
one fight and it's like a fight uh you
know where it was literally us
disagreeing on what to do with the
direction of one of the companies
like that was the actual that was the
fight and it was over within 30 minutes
um and it wasn't yelling it was just
like i strongly disagree with this
position
i don't see i don't see how this aligns
with our mission right
and so it was but the thing is is when
we have these things that we can compare
it to this is what we said our mission
was this is what we said our values are
then we have this third party that we
can compare based on our original
agreement of how we were going to enter
this relationship how we're gonna be
husband and wife together and so we have
learned to love one another

61
01:00:00.000 --> 01:01:00.000
because we are similar and that's where
a lot of the
the the chemistry comes from friction
right
become totally being opposite to one
another you're like i just hate you but
i
love it right there's that feeling but
that's a feeling and then you realize
six months later you're like i actually
just [ __ ] hate you right
right like you actually believe
everything that's opposite to what i
believe and you don't want to do in life
what i want to do and you don't want to
get through the way i want to get there
and then people just are in this
relationship that they're stuck and then
they make the commitment because they're
like i guess that's what i should do now
and then they just don't know what to do
i'm not saying can't salvage marriage
but i think there needs to be a new
agreement
that has to be entered of like this is
what we would like to do and if the
thing is is they're not aligned
i'm not pro-divorce because i am
pro-high commitment
but unless you can come to an agreement
of what you want life to look like
then you're literally going to be both
going in other directions
so i can talk to you more about
relationships oh it's wonderful i love
hearing you have to know when to quit
i think that's you know that's the thing
about divorce i i am pro-commitment as
well but you also have to know when to
quit you know
you have to know when it's not working
ryan and i are the same we met actually

62
01:01:00.000 --> 01:02:00.000
ours was slightly different we met on a
friday uh we met on a tuesday
we went for lunch on the saturday i went
for dinner at his house on the friday
and i was pregnant
uh two weeks later so we celebrated 11
months together with an eight-week old
baby on a mortgage
not even joking it was like so fast and
then we had four kids in five years so
it happened really quickly but you're
right about the core values is so
important but i think though that you're
what you have that many people lack
especially men and i don't want to be
hard on males but generally men are not
as emotionally aware
as you are um men men exist i find very
much on the thought realm and women are
much more in the emotional realm and so
i think that
because you're so self-aware and because
you evaluate because you're very process
oriented you're able to
evaluate um from a not from an
unemotional state but
from an unemotional state and actually
see you know and are your core values
the same and
but that that that comes from knowing
yourself
as well alex you know knowing yourself

63
01:02:00.000 --> 01:03:00.000
many people just don't
know themselves as well as you know
yourself
i just want to add a piece of color to
this that might probably value
i think a lot of people don't know what
words mean and what i mean by that is
a lot of people don't know how to name
emotions and so
especially men but i mean i think it
goes for i think it goes both ways but
like for example i'm frustrated well
that could mean a lot of things right
it could be i feel like an injustice was
done to me it could feel like i am
disrespected
i could feel i i could feel embarrassed
i could feel shame
over something that i did i could feel
envy i could feel jealousy
do people know the difference between
envy and jealousy they are different
and if you can name the emotion i think
a lot of times just
literally naming it gives you control
over it and then it stops controlling
you and then you can
assess is the reason that i'm feeling
this emotion justified
and then all of a sudden it like you can
pull outside of yourself and look at it
and i think if if people just spent time
on learning the words and what it means

64
01:03:00.000 --> 01:04:00.000
then they would probably have a lot
easier time managing through life yeah i
agree i agree and also what i would love
to put on this is
like this we could have gone this
podcast and i'm gonna i'm gonna let you
go soon
i promise but we could have you know i
could have gone with this podcast in a
in
you know drawing on all of your
expertise and building companies and
and doing all that which is kind of what
i've heard you speak a lot of but i
guess what i always try and teach and
what i really wanted to see could i find
in you which and you would be there of
course
um is you know what what you're talking
about effectively
is is becoming um as you say being able
to
to label an emotion and being able to
label an emotion be able to talk about
it being able to separate
yourself from what you're feeling and
then being able to identify that and
then have a conversation
like that that is actually effectively
sales right that's knowing how to
how to sell yourself like my husband i
were having this chat the other day
there was it was something about money
there was
uh he was getting a chunk of money from
his company and he wanted to put it into
pension and i said well actually i
prefer that money to go here
and and he was like no no well hang on
we agreed that such and such and i said

65
01:04:00.000 --> 01:05:00.000
but what and we started to get into a
bit of a right wrong about it i was like
hang on
stop stop stop i said let's pull back i
said we're talking about different
things i said let me explain to you why
i'm feeling this way
i feel i've worked really hard all year
and i'm feeling exhausted i need the
break and so
i was able to say emotionally i actually
want to feel supported by you
emotionally with this with this money
and he was like oh
okay well that makes total sense for me
that doesn't make sense to me because
for me the sense in saving the tax
whatever
we were talking about two completely
different things i was saying will you
support me emotionally
and he was saying i just want to make
financial sense so we weren't even
talking about the same thing
but because we were able to go out of
content and into process and actually
realize where we were discussing
i i heard what he wanted he heard what i
wanted and we came to your decision
like that but be having the ability to
do that is
not many people have it but when you
have it alex and this is where i want to
take it back into business then i just
want you to tell us quickly before we go
about jim launch but
i this is having you're like so great
there's so much we can talk about
um having that ability makes you

66
01:05:00.000 --> 01:06:00.000
a good salesperson it makes you a good
business person it makes you
someone who shows up in the gym who can
identify your process identify your
limitations can
can overcome that and make better
decisions simply being aware
simply being aware of you
your emotions your physical body your
emotional body and how
that affects the world your place in the
world
is simply life-changing and that i think
is what separates an entrepreneur
from or someone like you um like a
highly highly successful entrepreneur
from a regular person i believe that
actually all starts with us and once you
figure that [ __ ] out everything else
flows your relationships
your kids if you have them your work
life your bodybuilding your goal setting
your nutrition you have to figure
yourself out first would you agree
yes yes kim i agree i concur
alex uh so much good stuff here before

67
01:06:00.000 --> 01:07:00.000
we go i want you to give a shout out
because we have a lot of gym owners
listening to this
and i was um and i know you don't just
have jim launch you have several
companies prestige labs and
alan is that yeah ask allen jeff so but
i was telling my own trainer mark eddie
about you and layla whenever i first met
you're talking about layla and he was
like and he owns the gym and he was like
what is that they do
and what's this about jim's and who's
this whatever and he was like he didn't
he wasn't interested in you at all he
just wanted to hear about jim launch
so because honestly i'm not joking
because we do have a lot of
personal trainers and gym owners and
different things you know
who listen to this podcast tell us a
little bit more you know
tell us a little bit more about what you
do give it a shout out
so uh for jim specifically we help them
solve three main problems the first is
that they can't acquire customers
profitably
and so what that means is they have a
budget on marketing some of them don't
even have a budget
but they try and spend and once they
spend it that means it's gone
if you can market and acquire customers
properly
the right way then you can have a

68
01:07:00.000 --> 01:08:00.000
negative acquisition cost which is just
fancy speed for
making more money getting a customer
then it costs you to get them
which means if i were to send a thousand
dollars sorry spend a hundred dollars
on advertising then a customer would
come pre-loaded with
400 in their pocket and then i could
take 100
to cover the cost of them take another
100 to get another customer and still
have 200 to go put in my pocket
and by doing that i can continue to
spend and so what that does is it allows
somebody who's capital constrained aka
does not have a lot of money to be able
to acquire customers
at infinite basically as many as they
want what that does is it removes the
bottleneck of getting new customers as a
problem for the facility
which then introduces the second problem
which is that once they remove the
bottleneck of acquisition of their
facility
they realize that their full capacity
and yet their bank account is empty
because they do not have a good pricing
model and their fulfillment model is
broken
and so we help them price package their
services in a way that will maximize the
profit facility
and ultimately make them much more
durable the third piece is that once you
have customers that you're applying
properly
and you are making good money on them
because you're priced appropriately

69
01:08:00.000 --> 01:09:00.000
people leave
retention you know churn happens and so
what are the what are the processes
that are repeatable that are not
personality driven meaning you don't
have to be the one doing it
that drive people just pay and stay in
the long term
right so we've identified from the
process that i laid out in the very
beginning
what the top one percent of gym owners
do for each of those things
and we've duplicated those things across
you know thousands of gems now so we
know the processes work
and so fundamentally that is what we do
with gyms and so we have you know when
someone comes on the first thing we do
is we generate cash flow immediately
from
free traffic sources and that gives them
usually a 10 to 20 000
injection from there we then do what we
call an internal play which is then we
add retail
products to their to their services
which is prestige labs our supplement
company which we formulated just for
gyms
so they're priced protected against
amazon and all that stuff and it
provides them more margining commissions
than any other company
so we actually just crossed 10 million
dollars paid out so i've paid 10
000 and 10 million dollars in
commissions um
to the gym committee which is kind of
cool uh just to show you that the sales

70
01:09:00.000 --> 01:10:00.000
process works
we paid out 10 million uh in commissions
to this
and so the next thing we do is we we
basically add more value to the clients
without adding more sessions
right we max we take another we solve
another problem for our clients without
needing more square footage
and so that becomes another revenue
profit driver facility
and then after that now they have cash
flow they have a second revenue stream
that didn't require any overhead
then we take their cash and we invest in
growth and that's the process that i did
with
jim's and i you know i did 33 gym
turnarounds before i started packaging
up that process
um so it was me flying out and doing
this in person and so we know the
process and what it looks like and so we
just take gems through that we've done 4
000
in the last four years i can i can say
with a lot of confidence i don't think
anyone's close to us and i'm not saying
that arrogantly i'm just saying as a
matter of fact
i mean the fact that we're 10 times
bigger than anyone else in the space and
i know the other guys in the space i
help them because i'd rather than just
do a good job
um and most of them just reduplicate our
content which is fine and honestly i
don't i'm at a point where i don't care
i'd rather just have generic money

71
01:10:00.000 --> 01:11:00.000
