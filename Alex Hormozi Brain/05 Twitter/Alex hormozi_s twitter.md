Your actions are the end result of your values.

"Our words directly influence the way we think &amp; view the world.

Occasionally I'll say something that really stands out to me.

Sometimes I take mental notes. Other times, I forget what I said.

Here are a few of the #mozisms that have stuck with me over the years:"
Operations is the science and art of doing more, better.
"One of the most valuable shifts I made as an entrepreneur was going from:

Envy: “This guy makes more than me, but he’s unethical. I hate him. Boo!”

To

Curiosity: “Anyone who makes more $ than me is better than me in some way at the game of business. I should learn what it is.”"
"The reason “riches are in the niches” is not because there’s actually more money there but because there’s easier money there.

As you get bigger, so too can the size of the market you serve. 

But it takes time.

Context: Amazon did $150M in only book sales before it sold CDs."
Recessions prune the economic tree and determine who and what are actually “essential.”

"I've been ""rich"" and I've been poor.

Here are some of the most impactful lessons I learned from both sides of the spectrum:"
Most rules were once ‘make believe’.
"I remind myself that doing the basics without fail makes a person advanced.

Smile
Be interested
Listen more than you talk
Look people in their eyes 

Simple things often forsaken for ‘advanced’ interpersonal tactics."
"@bradleyhamner Training. 

And if they’re incapable after training communication and motivation, they’re not a fit."
"Here’s a visual of the three factors of employee success.

Hit all three and you have better odds at a productive teammate. https://t.co/RLl9eE63k9"
"If they know why it’s important to the mission overall, to you, to their peers, to the customer, and most importantly how it helps them become their best selves (while also lining their pockets)…

You’ll probably have more people moving in alignment towards your vision.

If they know how you want it to be done, within the context of their workload, and can refer back to training if they get lost…

A) Don’t explain how it helps the company overall (make it feel pointless)
B) Dont explain how it helps others in co.
C) Dont explain how it helps the customer.
D) Dont align the task to the values they claim to have
E) Dont reward financially"
"2) Don’t train them on how to do it:

A) Make sure they don’t know how to do it.
B) The way you want it done.
C) Within the context of their workload and other tasks.
D) Don’t document the training so you/they can refer back to it."

B) Don’t record it anywhere if you do.

D) Never give them the metric you care about.

Stories are so valuable because you can get another person’s lessons without getting their scars.
If you struggle to give your services away for free it’s because the highest cost of your service isn’t the price, it’s something else.
A lot of us struggle to let go of the good for the great because—we can quantify what we have to lose not what we stand to gain.
Make it so you don’t need to fake it.
Tough it before you bluff it.
"And the last one especially for you savages on Twitter.

Do your time before you rhyme."

Should switch to

Confidence comes from experience not bravado.

Truth &gt; Lies

Prove it to yourself so you don’t need to prove it to others.

Let your path do your talking for you."
Saying you ‘deserve’ something is placing an expectation on a universe that can’t hear you and being upset when it doesn’t obey.
"Hard convo framework that kills:

“I’ve noticed you haven’t been responding quickly to emails and that’s so unlike you. Do you think it’s:

1) You don’t want to (motivation)
2) You don’t know how to (training)
3) You didn’t know it was an expectation (comms)”

I love this script."
"Imagine every past customer still paid you today—how big would your business be?

Once I understood this, I understood how to build a big business.

It takes time. And I had to focus on making stuff people keep buying.

This way effort stacks rather than restarting monthly."
You grow businesses to immense size not by selling more, but by keeping those you sell…then adding time.
"I still feel like the time tested best response to doubters is: “watch me”

Results always speak louder than any clever comeback ever can."
"Cold calling and high volume selling are valuable because of the skills you learn, not the $.

It’s hard to take 20+ consults a day and not get good.

And once you’re good, it’s like getting a permanent $200k/yr pay raise. 

It’s worth giving a year to gain the skill for life."

"6. Cross-Sell them

Get them to buy similar offers.

To get from $5000/mo to $50,000/mo…than to invest $125,000 for 40 years.

Why? Because sometimes you just gotta make more.

It’s like a business trying to optimize to 70% margins on $100k/yr."

The problem for them was they never delivered the skills.

"Too many folks are too cheap with themselves.

They obsess about how little they spend. But they don’t differentiate between investment and consumption.

"I lived cheap coming up. 

But I was making so little, saving felt pointless. 

So instead of saving my money, I invested it all on courses, coaching, workshops, books.

"RT @AlexHormozi: Our portfolio companies make $75,000 per working hour (40 hrs/wk). 

Building this has taken a long time.

Here are a few…"
We need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.
"Excerpt from $100M Leads:

“How we define words affects how we think. After all, words represent thoughts. Unclear words make for unclear thinking. And unclear thinking makes it very difficult to understand.”

Wisdom begins with a definition of terms. - Socrates"
"Make promises. Keep promises. Build brand.

Use brand to increase prices above market.

Use extra profits to spur growth through hiring better people &amp; new channels.

Give slices of the pie to get a bigger piece overall.

Then give time, time."
11) The recipe for success (in my opinion) can be boiled down to this:
"10) Sell what customers want, not what you want to build.

We don't matter.

Lead with data rather than ego."
"You only take company-sized risk when not doing so risks the company. 

Otherwise, the risk-adjusted return just cant be supported."
"9) Any number, no matter how big, multiplied by zero, is zero.

Risks are to be respected. 

The biggest companies take actions that have as little downside risk as possible."
"The biggest companies in our portfolio obsess over hundreds of 1% improvements vs 2x next 90 days.

10%/qrtr x 10 years = 40x growth. But most only swing for the fences (and strike out a lot)"
8) Compounding in business creates breathtaking results when you add the one ingredient most hate: time.
"7) Level 10 talent is only attracted to level 10 opportunities.

And you need level 10 talent to build anything big.

We must think long and hard about how big this can be so that other people's dreams can fit inside."
"6) Emotions are the enemy.

Nothing is ever as good or bad as we expect except for the things we don't.

Be wary of giant projections or catastrophizing. 

Both are extremes that lead to poor decisions. 

It's often the things we don't expect that yield the outsized returns."
"5) Simple scales. Fancy fails.

Scale creates complexity all on its own. 

You don't need to help it. 

To scale, things need to be dead simple, which means not risking the empire for a pot of gold."
"4) Brand matters. A lot.

The measurement of brand strength is your ability to price above market rates. 

In a very real way, the brand creates profits."
Think - what could I do for a long time rather than what will make me money today.
"3) Big things take time. 

Rather than thinking of this as a patience platitude—

Think of it like this:

""If I want something big, I have to be motivated to do this for a long period. It must be a cause worth pursuing."""
"2) The size of your slice of the pie matters more than the shape.

Many people's egos want 100% of the pie (circle shape), whereas your bank account only cares how much it weighs.

Get people other people tied &amp; compensated for the achievement of your vision."
"1) Most things don't matter. 

A few things matter a lot. 

You can achieve outsized returns by only focusing on those few.

Figure out the few &amp; ruthlessly eliminate the rest."
"Our portfolio companies make $75,000 per working hour (40 hrs/wk). 

Building this has taken a long time.

Here are a few lessons I've learned:"
"Most people overestimate how much a business bet pays off and underestimate the risks/costs.

The outsized returns usually come from the things you don’t expect."
"When times are good, focus on what’s going wrong. 

When times are bad, focus on what’s going right.

Leaders keep the team grounded &amp; away from either extreme of delusional optimism or pessimism."
"He now invests in internet businesses making at minimum $3M+ per year. 

He helps them make a lot more money than they were before. 

He also wrote a book called $100M Offers. People say it was good. 

People say nice and impressive things about Alex."
Alex grew a gym licensing business, an e-commerce company, and an agency saas business. The companies made lots of money. He then sold the companies to private equity funds for more money. People were very impressed.
I hate speaker bios. Thinking about changing mine. Added a little humor…Lmk if ya catch it.
“If some is good, more is better” is more often than not the correct answer when scaling.
"Trust lubricates business. 

The more you have, the faster things go."
"We stop teaching people how to read at grade 5 and just expect them to get better on their own.

One of the biggest boosts I got in marketing was when I switched to writing for their understanding rather than my ego."

I ended up selling MORE overall.

After running out, people kept asking about products we had sold out of.

Operations is the science and art of doing more, better.
"One of the most valuable shifts I made as an entrepreneur was going from:

Envy: “This guy makes more than me, but he’s unethical. I hate him. Boo!”

To

Curiosity: “Anyone who makes more $ than me is better than me in some way at the game of business. I should learn what it is.”"
"The reason “riches are in the niches” is not because there’s actually more money there but because there’s easier money there.

As you get bigger, so too can the size of the market you serve.

Be interested
Listen more than you talk

"If they know why it’s important to the mission overall, to you, to their peers, to the customer, and most importantly how it helps them become their best selves (while also lining their pockets)…

You’ll probably have more people moving in alignment towards your vision.

E) Dont reward financially"

Stories are so valuable because you can get another person’s lessons without getting their scars.
If you struggle to give your services away for free it’s because the highest cost of your service isn’t the price, it’s something else.
A lot of us struggle to let go of the good for the great because—we can quantify what we have to lose not what we stand to gain.

Saying you ‘deserve’ something is placing an expectation on a universe that can’t hear you and being upset when it doesn’t obey.
"Hard convo framework that kills:

“I’ve noticed you haven’t been responding quickly to emails and that’s so unlike you. Do you think it’s:

1) You don’t want to (motivation)
2) You don’t know how to (training)
3) You didn’t know it was an expectation (comms)”

I love this script."
"Imagine every past customer still paid you today—how big would your business be?

Once I understood this, I understood how to build a big business.

You grow businesses to immense size not by selling more, but by keeping those you sell…then adding time.

"6. Cross-Sell them

Get them to buy similar offers.

"3. Gross Profit

Total profit after deducting the CAC and COGS from your revenue.

Revenue - CAC - COGS = Gross Profit"

The goal is to make clients lots of money… so that you can charge them lots of money.

"The longest HODL you’ll ever have is on yourself.

Invest accordingly."
"I mean, you can do it. But it makes more sense to spend the $70,000 per year marketing your stuff so you can make $500,000 next year.

Live cheap so that you can invest to increase your future earnings THEN save BIG.

Not so that you can save $500/mo for 50 years."
"It makes more sense to spend $2000/mo on courses &amp; coaching for 5 years…

To get from $5000/mo to $50,000/mo…than to invest $125,000 for 40 years.

Why? Because sometimes you just gotta make more.

It’s like a business trying to optimize to 70% margins on $100k/yr."
"I’m gonna be real for a minute.

Saving money to get a modest return is fine. But it’s playing life on hard mode.

You need to buy yourself extra lives. You do that by increasing income."
"The formal education college folks got it right—it makes sense to borrow money from your future self to increase skills today.

The problem for them was they never delivered the skills.

If you work hard, leveraging future earnings (debt) is a fast track to increasing $ faster."
"When I was poor I saved so that I could invest in me, not the SP500.

I can 10x my income with better skills. The sp500 cannot. 

The younger you are the higher percentage of your income you can/should spend on getting skills that create more income."
"Too many folks are too cheap with themselves.

They obsess about how little they spend. But they don’t differentiate between investment and consumption.

If you spend money to learn how to draw blood (2 day cert) you can make $25/hr instantly.

3x min wage for a 2 day investment."
"I lived cheap coming up. 

But I was making so little, saving felt pointless. 

So instead of saving my money, I invested it all on courses, coaching, workshops, books.

I never thought “Alex you should be saving more.” 

My problem wasn’t my living expenses, it was my income…🧵"
‘Litty kitty’ feels underused.
"The reason enjoying the stuff you do makes you more money is because of consistency and longevity.

You do stuff you like.

"RT @AlexHormozi: Our portfolio companies make $75,000 per working hour (40 hrs/wk). 

Building this has taken a long time.

Here are a few…"
We need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.
"Excerpt from $100M Leads:

“How we define words affects how we think. After all, words represent thoughts. Unclear words make for unclear thinking. And unclear thinking makes it very difficult to understand.”

Wisdom begins with a definition of terms. - Socrates"
"Make promises. Keep promises. Build brand.

Use brand to increase prices above market.

Use extra profits to spur growth through hiring better people &amp; new channels.

Give slices of the pie to get a bigger piece overall.

Then give time, time."
11) The recipe for success (in my opinion) can be boiled down to this:
"10) Sell what customers want, not what you want to build.

We don't matter.

Lead with data rather than ego."
"You only take company-sized risk when not doing so risks the company. 

Otherwise, the risk-adjusted return just cant be supported."
"9) Any number, no matter how big, multiplied by zero, is zero.

Risks are to be respected. 

The biggest companies take actions that have as little downside risk as possible."
"The biggest companies in our portfolio obsess over hundreds of 1% improvements vs 2x next 90 days.

10%/qrtr x 10 years = 40x growth. But most only swing for the fences (and strike out a lot)"
8) Compounding in business creates breathtaking results when you add the one ingredient most hate: time.
"7) Level 10 talent is only attracted to level 10 opportunities.

And you need level 10 talent to build anything big.

We must think long and hard about how big this can be so that other people's dreams can fit inside."
"6) Emotions are the enemy.

Nothing is ever as good or bad as we expect except for the things we don't.

Be wary of giant projections or catastrophizing. 

Both are extremes that lead to poor decisions. 

It's often the things we don't expect that yield the outsized returns."
"5) Simple scales. Fancy fails.

Scale creates complexity all on its own. 

You don't need to help it. 

To scale, things need to be dead simple, which means not risking the empire for a pot of gold."
"4) Brand matters. A lot.

The measurement of brand strength is your ability to price above market rates. 

In a very real way, the brand creates profits."
Think - what could I do for a long time rather than what will make me money today.
"3) Big things take time. 

Rather than thinking of this as a patience platitude—

Think of it like this:

""If I want something big, I have to be motivated to do this for a long period. It must be a cause worth pursuing."""
"2) The size of your slice of the pie matters more than the shape.

Many people's egos want 100% of the pie (circle shape), whereas your bank account only cares how much it weighs.

Get people other people tied &amp; compensated for the achievement of your vision."
"1) Most things don't matter. 

A few things matter a lot. 

You can achieve outsized returns by only focusing on those few.

Figure out the few &amp; ruthlessly eliminate the rest."
"Our portfolio companies make $75,000 per working hour (40 hrs/wk). 

Building this has taken a long time.

Here are a few lessons I've learned:"
"Most people overestimate how much a business bet pays off and underestimate the risks/costs.

The outsized returns usually come from the things you don’t expect."
"When times are good, focus on what’s going wrong. 

When times are bad, focus on what’s going right.

Leaders keep the team grounded &amp; away from either extreme of delusional optimism or pessimism."
"He now invests in internet businesses making at minimum $3M+ per year. 

He helps them make a lot more money than they were before. 

He also wrote a book called $100M Offers. People say it was good. 

People say nice and impressive things about Alex."
Alex grew a gym licensing business, an e-commerce company, and an agency saas business. The companies made lots of money. He then sold the companies to private equity funds for more money. People were very impressed.
I hate speaker bios. Thinking about changing mine. Added a little humor…Lmk if ya catch it.
“If some is good, more is better” is more often than not the correct answer when scaling.
"Trust lubricates business. 

The more you have, the faster things go."
"We stop teaching people how to read at grade 5 and just expect them to get better on their own.

One of the biggest boosts I got in marketing was when I switched to writing for their understanding rather than my ego."

My Lesson: 
What it takes &gt; What you think it takes."
Nothing is ever as good or bad as we expect, except for the things we don’t.
There’s wonderful satisfaction in making a plan, seeing it work and thinking, “Gosh, I’m not an idiot.”
That’s why they call things “labors of love”
How much you’re willing to sacrifice for someone is the measurement of how much you love them (or what they give you).
"You increase how much you get out by increasing how much you put in.

You multiply how much you get out by adding leverage to what you put in.

But, you have to first do shit to multiply it.

Many people waste time multiplying zero."

"11. Selling is a transference of belief over a bridge of trust.

Therefore, you must have the belief first, then build trust to transfer it."
"10. Closing is a dance, not a fight.

It is seduction, not rape."
"9. Seek to understand, not argue.

You cannot influence someone you do not understand."
"8. Prioritize helping your prospects—

Not the sale.

It's not about you."
"7. Selling is helping prospects make decisions to help themselves.

The objective is not to get them to buy but to get them to decide."
"6. Selling correctly is the first step to helping your prospects.

Your first impression and the expectations you set will dictate the relationship."
"5. If you didn't get a gasp from the price tag—

You didn't go high enough.

Raise your prices."
"4. Expect and plan for NO.

It is not failure; it is expected. 

If they could decide without you, you would be unnecessary.

No is the job.

Stop being surprised."
"3. It's easier to handle obstacles than objections.

Obstacles are when YOU disagree with the prospect.

Objections are when THEY disagree with you.

Diffuse obstacles early, so they do not become objections and blow up the sale in the close."
"2. Selling happens before you ask for the sale.

Closing begins after."
"1. People want to believe you.

They inherently want to buy.

You need to help their logical brains justify that emotional decision."
17 lessons you must learn if you want to be a top 1% salesperson:
"When you lose your money, you lose nothing.

When you lose your time, you lose something.

When you lose your character, you lose everything."
When you transition from player to game maker, you win.
Saying you'll put in the work, and actually doing it are two totally different things.
"Swap the word:

""change"" for ""improvement""

""belief"" for ""assumption""

""try"" for ""will"""
The best time to start was years ago when you were thinking about starting.
"There are no hacks, tips or tricks to building character.

It is a lifelong pursuit.

A beautiful infinite game."
"I saw a man raised in addiction feel like a success by soberly holding down a job.

I saw a man born to wealth feel like a failure for not surpassing his father's wealth.

We are rich the moment we choose to be."
May you never run out of humility &amp; integrity.
Sales slumps are temporary.
"Never stop hustling because others don't understand you.

It's okay (and normal) to outgrow their standards.

Just don't let anyone's opinion extinguish the fire of you living up to your potential."
"You are successful because of the values you embody when you work (permanent)—

Not the outcome of the work (impermanent)."
The hardest standards to raise are our own.
"Many religious people have tremendous peace because they trade approval from others for approval from God (ideals).

And if you don't believe in God, you next best bet is approval from self."
"If you want to live an uncommon life, you cannot have common views.

Expect opposition."
"If getting rich were easy, everyone would do it.

And if it were, it wouldn't be remarkable.

So we shouldn't wish it to be easier, but instead to be worthy."
"The more you go through, the more you realize you CAN go through.

In this way, our trials create our character."
"Don't play to win, play to play.

And when you do that, you cannot lose.

Get your bag."
"The only judgement you'll live your whole life with is your own.

Stop tolerating your own mediocrity or your excuses for inaction.

We learn through experience, so collect some.

Then...wait ten years (because in the scheme of life this IS fast)."
"DO. DAILY.

Do not cast power to your excuses.

Own your circumstances because no one else will.

Realize you are SOURCE."
"Multitasking is like balancing spinning plates.

Sure, it sounds exciting.

But you'll unlock the compounding effects of narrowly focused attention."
"Determine what you are willing to sacrifice on the altar of your goals.

Then sacrifice them.

This will give you all the room to double down on ONE thing."
"Multiple income streams is how you STAY rich not how you GET rich.

If you want to become a millionaire fast, do this:"
"Ironically, many sacrifice financial freedom to buy goods for perceived social status.

When in reality, financial freedom provides social status.

When your priorities are sequenced properly, you get both."
"The point of the game is to work hard always.

Not ""so that x."" Just to work hard. Period.

Work is the reward."
With people and products, buying cheap has expensive consequences.
"The more you give—

The more you realize you have.

When you have ""enough"" everything else becomes more than you need."
"C#5 Competition - Public leaderboards.

Update these DAILY.

Reward your best closers with fun prizes/bonuses every 6 weeks.

This is worth every dollar.

And keeps everyone striving to do better."
"C#4 - Cut the fat regularly.

Even if everything is going okay.

Winning teams don't allow mediocrity to drag down culture.

Culture drives performance."
"C#3 Communication - Talk to your team daily.

Daily huddles where you hype them up with testimonials.

This builds their conviction to sell.

Weekly one on ones.

Review their best call, worst call, and average call.

You cannot solve problems if you don't shine a light on them."
"C#2 Call Recordings - Record every single call your team makes.

This holds your team accountable to follow the script.

Review these regularly to coach your team.

What gets monitored gets improved."
"C#1 Use The CLOSER Framework.

Clarify why the prospect is there.

Label the core problem.

Overview their pain.

Sell the vacation.

Explain away their concerns.

Reinforce their buying decision."
"I call this the Five C's Framework.

It's brain dead simple—

Yet ridiculously effective."

"Tolerating poverty is an option.

Complaining about it is not.

Accept or change. But do not blame."
@Dar3ios Prone to sickness. Incapable of doing activities you’d like to do.
Having a strong bank account with a weak body is like having a lifetime supply of gasoline to fuel a bicycle.
@WorkBrah @JoshKing65 @JoshKing65 - Not us. Sorry bro. They create accounts faster than we can get them shutdown. Just gotta read the @username for typos. We have no other accounts. If you’re not sure (besides me literally saying “I have nothing to sell you” in every damn video), look at engagement.
You need a better reason than "money" to waste your life doing something you hate.
The only differences between a prophecy &amp; reality are work &amp; time.
"When you build a life for YOU, you'll never need to escape from it.

That is real self-care no glass of wine and lazy Sunday can give you."
Stop tolerating shit you hate.
If you run from your spouse, you probably need to confront the unpleasant conversations.
If you need to rest after hanging out with friends, you probably need new friends.
If you have to run away from your work, you're probably doing shit you hate.
"Self care" shouldn't be an escape, this is why:
"Building a business is risky.

Living paycheck to paycheck is risky.

Some risks come with upside.

Others do not.

Risk wisely."
No one owns truth.
"First, we blame our circumstances.
Then, we blame other people.
Finally, we blame ourselves.

And once we accept, we take our first steps as free men."
"Expectations must be simplified enough to be repeated daily. 

No one can be above them and it starts at the top."
"“Selling is a transference of belief over a bridge of trust.”

The easiest way to solve a problem is to decide it’s not a problem anymore.
Aligning with other’s self interest is easier than persuading them to do what you want.
"@tylerguitar_ I would argue, to the point of unpolitical correctness, that they deemed that action in their own best interest.

If you bet on people to act in their own self interest, you will be right a lot.

Morning thoughts."
"This manifests the trait of humility that people like.

Why?

Because as you’re ego needs no more feeding, you can direct the energy to feeding others.

As humility isn’t putting oneself down, it’s raising others up (independent of self)."
"If you have a “well fed ego” it means you can satisfy your own needs.

You do so by admiring yourself to the point of satisfaction.

Easy to say - hard to do. Our own respect is the hardest to earn.

That being said, the satisfied ego has a surplus which can be directed to others"
"But the admiration they get from others, because it was based in a lie is fleeting.

It doesn’t satisfy. So they move onto the next people to admire them.

This is why having a “big ego” isn’t really having a big ego at all.

Instead you have a malnourished ego that needs feeding"
"To decrease your ego, you can either:

1) Need less admiration
2) Admire yourself more

Self admiration/respect is not what people make it out to be.

It means you actually meet your own standards of respect.

Most people don’t. So they lie to meet the standards of others."
"Craving the admiration of others comes down to two things:

2) How much you can feed it yourself

"Easy way to resolve disagreements with significant other: TEXT.

More important than when is how much uninterrupted time you hold.

Do not put other people's priorities over your own."
"Execute: get the information and begin failing forward.

Pay whatever you need to to get the insights, training, etc. to figure out:

1) What is your limiter

2) How do you fix it

Then do so."
"Stop responding to 'asks.'

When people message you, there is an implied demand to respond.

"Enter a ""season of no.""

Say no to anything that is not your priority.

This doesn't have to last forever.

Only as long as it takes you to remove the bottleneck."
"Having a priority means that two things cannot be equally important.

One MUST be more important.

The one you choose should be the system limiter.

There is no point in adding potential to a limited system. Attack the bottleneck, and ignore the rest.

7 anti-routines (and tactics) that took me from $1M to $100M:
"No course on its own will teach you to be rich.

The decision to voraciously learn will."
"Theory is a poor substitute for experience when acquiring skills.

In the words of LH Hardwick:

""A man with experience is never at the mercy of a man with an opinion.""

Pick which man you prefer to be."
"I recommend spending all excess cash on acquiring skills until you have so much that you can't possibly spend it on more skills.

Increase your capacity to earn, which increases the value of your highest cash-producing asset (you).

Relevant for today - skills are inflation-proof"

"17. Power is the ability to direct or influence people or events.

The process of influencing people is selling.

If you desire to be powerful, you must learn to sell."
"16. Record your sales calls. Always.

You cannot improve what you do not get feedback on."
15. The person who cares the most about the prospect wins the deal.
"14. Closers ask hard questions—

Everyone in their lives lies to them, especially themselves.

You must ask the profound truth questions they are afraid of answering."
"13. Belief and trust are continuums, not binaries.

It's not WHETHER they trust or believe you, but HOW MUCH that dictates the sale.

Act accordingly."
"12. You can only build trust if you genuinely want to help.

Why? Because humans are exceptionally good at sniffing out intention.

No 'hack' will replace the trust built from a genuine desire to help."
"11. Selling is a transference of belief over a bridge of trust.

Therefore, you must have the belief first, then build trust to transfer it."
"10. Closing is a dance, not a fight.

It is seduction, not rape."
"9. Seek to understand, not argue.

You cannot influence someone you do not understand."
"8. Prioritize helping your prospects—

Not the sale.

It's not about you."
"7. Selling is helping prospects make decisions to help themselves.

The objective is not to get them to buy but to get them to decide."
"6. Selling correctly is the first step to helping your prospects.

Your first impression and the expectations you set will dictate the relationship."
"5. If you didn't get a gasp from the price tag—

You didn't go high enough.

Raise your prices."
"4. Expect and plan for NO.

It is not failure; it is expected. 

If they could decide without you, you would be unnecessary.

No is the job.

Stop being surprised."
"3. It's easier to handle obstacles than objections.

Obstacles are when YOU disagree with the prospect.

Objections are when THEY disagree with you.

Diffuse obstacles early, so they do not become objections and blow up the sale in the close."
"2. Selling happens before you ask for the sale.

Closing begins after."
"1. People want to believe you.

They inherently want to buy.

You need to help their logical brains justify that emotional decision."
17 lessons you must learn if you want to be a top 1% salesperson:
"When you lose your money, you lose nothing.

When you lose your time, you lose something.

When you lose your character, you lose everything."
When you transition from player to game maker, you win.
Saying you'll put in the work, and actually doing it are two totally different things.
"Swap the word:

""change"" for ""improvement""

""belief"" for ""assumption""

""try"" for ""will"""
The best time to start was years ago when you were thinking about starting.
"There are no hacks, tips or tricks to building character.

It is a lifelong pursuit.

A beautiful infinite game."
"I saw a man raised in addiction feel like a success by soberly holding down a job.

I saw a man born to wealth feel like a failure for not surpassing his father's wealth.

We are rich the moment we choose to be."
May you never run out of humility &amp; integrity.
Sales slumps are temporary.
"Never stop hustling because others don't understand you.

It's okay (and normal) to outgrow their standards.

Just don't let anyone's opinion extinguish the fire of you living up to your potential."
"You are successful because of the values you embody when you work (permanent)—

Not the outcome of the work (impermanent)."
The hardest standards to raise are our own.
"Many religious people have tremendous peace because they trade approval from others for approval from God (ideals).

And if you don't believe in God, you next best bet is approval from self."
"If you want to live an uncommon life, you cannot have common views.

Expect opposition."
"If getting rich were easy, everyone would do it.

And if it were, it wouldn't be remarkable.

So we shouldn't wish it to be easier, but instead to be worthy."
"The more you go through, the more you realize you CAN go through.

In this way, our trials create our character."
"Don't play to win, play to play.

And when you do that, you cannot lose.

Get your bag."
"The only judgement you'll live your whole life with is your own.

Stop tolerating your own mediocrity or your excuses for inaction.

We learn through experience, so collect some.

Then...wait ten years (because in the scheme of life this IS fast)."
"DO. DAILY.

Do not cast power to your excuses.

Own your circumstances because no one else will.

Realize you are SOURCE."
"Multitasking is like balancing spinning plates.

Sure, it sounds exciting.

But you'll unlock the compounding effects of narrowly focused attention."
"Determine what you are willing to sacrifice on the altar of your goals.

Then sacrifice them.

This will give you all the room to double down on ONE thing."
"Multiple income streams is how you STAY rich not how you GET rich.

If you want to become a millionaire fast, do this:"
"Ironically, many sacrifice financial freedom to buy goods for perceived social status.

When in reality, financial freedom provides social status.

When your priorities are sequenced properly, you get both."
"The point of the game is to work hard always.

Not ""so that x."" Just to work hard. Period.

Work is the reward."
With people and products, buying cheap has expensive consequences.
"The more you give—

The more you realize you have.

When you have ""enough"" everything else becomes more than you need."
"C#5 Competition - Public leaderboards.

Update these DAILY.

Reward your best closers with fun prizes/bonuses every 6 weeks.

This is worth every dollar.

And keeps everyone striving to do better."
"C#4 - Cut the fat regularly.

Even if everything is going okay.

Winning teams don't allow mediocrity to drag down culture.

Culture drives performance."
"C#3 Communication - Talk to your team daily.

Daily huddles where you hype them up with testimonials.

This builds their conviction to sell.

Weekly one on ones.

Review their best call, worst call, and average call.

You cannot solve problems if you don't shine a light on them."
"C#2 Call Recordings - Record every single call your team makes.

This holds your team accountable to follow the script.

Review these regularly to coach your team.

What gets monitored gets improved."
"C#1 Use The CLOSER Framework.

Clarify why the prospect is there.

Label the core problem.

Overview their pain.

Sell the vacation.

Explain away their concerns.

Reinforce their buying decision."
"I call this the Five C's Framework.

It's brain dead simple—

Yet ridiculously effective."

If you’re not sure (besides me literally saying “I have nothing to sell you” in every damn video), look at engagement.
You need a better reason than "money" to waste your life doing something you hate.
The only differences between a prophecy &amp; reality are work &amp; time.
"When you build a life for YOU, you'll never need to escape from it.

That is real self-care no glass of wine and lazy Sunday can give you."
Stop tolerating shit you hate.
If you run from your spouse, you probably need to confront the unpleasant conversations.
If you need to rest after hanging out with friends, you probably need new friends.
If you have to run away from your work, you're probably doing shit you hate.
"Self care" shouldn't be an escape, this is why:

The easiest way to solve a problem is to decide it’s not a problem anymore.
Aligning with other’s self interest is easier than persuading them to do what you want.
"@tylerguitar_ I would argue, to the point of unpolitical correctness, that they deemed that action in their own best interest.

"This manifests the trait of humility that people like.

Why?

Because as you’re ego needs no more feeding, you can direct the energy to feeding others.

As humility isn’t putting oneself down, it’s raising others up (independent of self)."
"If you have a “well fed ego” it means you can satisfy your own needs.

You do so by admiring yourself to the point of satisfaction.

Easy to say - hard to do. Our own respect is the hardest to earn.

That being said, the satisfied ego has a surplus which can be directed to others"
"But the admiration they get from others, because it was based in a lie is fleeting.

It doesn’t satisfy. So they move onto the next people to admire them.

This is why having a “big ego” isn’t really having a big ego at all.

Instead you have a malnourished ego that needs feeding"
"To decrease your ego, you can either:

1) Need less admiration
2) Admire yourself more

Self admiration/respect is not what people make it out to be.

It means you actually meet your own standards of respect.

Most people don’t. So they lie to meet the standards of others."

So in an attempt to get more, we remove what made it magical to begin with—scarcity &amp; relative cost. 

Enjoy stuff while it’s special."
"Wildly underrated skill for entrepreneurs:

Managing your income to expense ratio. 

(Ps - or anyone who wants to become very wealthy…as the first key to investing is to save money to do so!)"
"Markets in general will move to do more for customers for less. 

First movers do more for more.
Then more for less. 
Then eventually, more for nothing (free). 

And that original value becomes table stakes in a bigger game of value creation, and the first players move the goal."

"Youth is wasted on the young.
Experience is wasted by the old.

"I break down performance issues into 3 categories:
1) They don’t know HOW to do what you want them to do (skills)
2) They don’t WANT to do what you want them to do (motivation)
3) They don’t know THAT you want them to do it (communication breakdown)

Feel free to swipe."
"“When I was 20 I wanted to be a millionaire…Now that I’m a millionaire, I want to be 20.”

I overheard a version of this.

Makes me realize that when I’m 40, I’d rather be 32 (my age) with nothing, just to be 32 (again). 

A different frame on gratitude I thought I’d share."

"“There’s no such thing as news. Just the same stories with new characters.”

Nice perspective on these “unprecedented times”"
Most people suck at most things, especially the things they think they’re good at.
@arbaz_kh4n I think the key point is that the 0 cost leverage is the driver, not the “partnership” which could be structured unlimited ways
@arbaz_kh4n Not sure which part gave that indication (genuine q). But no, not what I’m saying. More partners for most complicates things and are done improperly, and doomed to fail.
"How I measure opportunity:

Total market size
X
Growth
X
Leverage of deliverable (Code/Media vs Service)

If high on all three, you’ve got a lvl10 opportunity. 

If low, you’ve got an opp that may eventually cap you. 

This is why for most:
franchising/licensing &gt; local ownership"
"Doing the basics at scale is what makes you advanced, not complexity.

Scale creates complexity in and of itself, you don’t need to add more by being fancy.

@BenTormey Yea. But how to achieve “redistribution” without someone “taking your shit”
@andrehaykaljr Appreciated
"Ex: 
Median wealth in US= ~$121,000
Top 1% wealth= ~$11,000,000

Let’s assume they’re both as good with their money (they’re not). 

In the next year, the gap grows wider by $1.1M, not because of evil. But because compounding works. 

In time a little advantage becomes a big one."
"The reason wealth inequality exists isn’t because of greed, it’s because of math. 
If everyone restarted at zero, in one generation there would be some with more and others with less.
Compound that “more” by 10% annually for 3 generations…and it becomes insurmountable."
"To the poor, time is a liability. 
To the wealthy, time is an asset.

Much easier to play games where if you wait, you win."
@brentgiesler Appreciated
I feel like if every marketer just wrote a book for the sake of providing value, rather than trying to get customers…they’d get more customers.
@SBrase Yep. People are shitty when they don’t know how to make money. Silly - because it would be easier to make more putting this energy to honest work.
Only we know whether we did our best. Long after we die, the values we chose to exemplify to ourselves, remain eternal.

"“A day in the life” is a misrepresentation. 
Instead: “decade in the life”

When people workout with me, they’re usually like “that’s it?”

They expect intensity, not consistency. 17 years of unfailing, repeated effort, creates outsized results. 

Same for business and marriage. https://t.co/FA4wB32LIi"

@JoeVampz @ProsperityOnly @FraserAlex1 😅🤣🤷🏻‍♂️🙏🏼
@realevandempsey @ProsperityOnly Read reviews on Amazon then make informed decision
If you have smart able clients, they will do better (even with the same resources). So your product in a real way will provide more value simply by choosing only the candidates with the highest likelihood of success.
If you raise the quality of your PROSPECT, you raise the quality of your PRODUCT.

Fancy fails. Simple scales.
"Quality of offer x # of offers x goodwill = $

Problem: more offers you make, in general, the less goodwill you have. 

Delicate dance. Goodwill is the force multiplier on the equation."
@sebcastillo69 Lol
@mvrckio Then make 10,000 offers…ah shucks. Not sure your conclusion is valid.

You’re not making as much money as you want because you’re not as good as you think you are.

It’s hard to guess what will grow 26% annually.

But it’s much easier for think: “what can I buy today that’s half the price it will in 2-3 years?” (With much of that being - is it half priced today?)
